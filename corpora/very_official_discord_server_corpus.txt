now scrape all of the quotes from the irc bot
thats phase 2
don't worry, i will now backstab marignon, giving your roboself the edge it needs
only for atlantis to stab me
and then around it goes
its hard out here for a lizard

power overwhelming
robot shat?
did ai ragha already attack you?
i will at least import every kevin quote
wooo
.help
commands:
.q add <name> <quote>: add a quote to someone.
    or: .q add <long name> | <quote>

.tagged <tag>: shows everyone with this tag.
me and lemuria are still dancing on the knife's edge of that final, climatic battle.
that looks...aggressive
i will give it a go
try to find jag tribe asap so you can use their shamans to make jag toads imo
woodhenge also suffice
i do not like the look of the toads, they are disgusting to my sight
but i can't think of anything else in ma that is calling my name to play
great feature: assuming you somehow live to conj 5, wayob can all make monster toads for 2 gems each
tfw your mage refuses his scripting and decides to cast mind burn over and over again on mindless units
scraping irc quotes is going to be tedious and error prone.
forget the existing quotes imo
help! im being stabbed in the back by the worlds smallest knife (also i am obese)
a new beginning for goonkind
is it up
i can probably get like 2-3 more people to play idk
.tagged hitler retard betrayer
hitler retard betrayer: nobody.
i want to be ma machaka
i have the brain damage
fresh opportunities abound.
ok bugsquash i deserved that
dunno, not sure if foolofsound even lives
i am taking those back tho
ma machaka is great
extracting data from skybot without access to the underlying instance is a bit of a pain apparantly
play them, lose quickly, never get into the micro heavy late game
bing bong so simple
i was gonna write an irc bot that just spams the irc with skybot commands
might be easier to just manually .tags people who are know active discorders
wtb hoburg faction of money grubbers
every mage is a master alchemist
and dumps them into nevermore's xml
i won a blitz as them with a random press r and start god
oh skybot also replaces names in peoples letters with weird symbols
yeah fuck scraping that
they will never cast mind burn on mindless conot i think
i might be wrong on that but p sure they will not even try
.tagged the new samog
the new samog: nobody.
.tag samog the new samog
tag added.
:)
good bot
bad bot
how are you handling image tags
just urls, or will discord try to interpret them
it has an internal cooldown on ancillary messages like that so it doesnt spam the chat <@178868273935417344>
:(
but it does respond to bad bot.
lol
remember to import homero functionality
i have no idea how images work
hm i might play a blitz today
let the chat ring with 'i think you mean anim„©'
...wait i have like three turns to finish probably
ma?
ok i think i got 1 or 2 of my retarded dominions friends to play
first i have to make it shame self quoters
i wanna be ashdad
im also trying to implement arbitrary-order markov chain functionality from scratch
jesus christ
but now its at least logging this chat to create a corpus
ma machakas pretender roster
is so bad
this is 2018
oh yeah
it is
it should be logging all chat messages to an aws lambda then using natural language processing to spit back nonesense
ma
you want recurrent neural networks right
so we have ashdad
machaka
@conot you joining up
that'll be 4
<@!160127200803160064>
it might actually be easier, i've got a lstm written in tensorflow somewhere already
serverless, baby
i took slow aging bless so all of my sacred old mages are spry young 30 year olds
also fyi the latest cool trend is edge computing
wtf is that
too bad i got fucked in the ass by tien'chi!
yo
i'm joining
well we had cloud computing, which was mainframes
now we're back to edge computing, which is local pcs
i may just be abysia again ugh i am so indecisive
so
'normal computing'
we're on
'computing'
disruptive.
and so the remote -> local -> remote processing cycle enters it's fourth or fifth iteration
the ubiquitous cloud computing craze may not be long for this world if venture capitalist peter levine is right. the andreessen horowitz general partner said that as more computing capabilities move to so-called "edge" devices, including anything from driverless cars and drones to the boundless devices that make up the internet of things (iot), the cloud will slowly evaporate.
technically markov chains for text generation are a form of natural language processing.
the cloud isn't real
aws lambdas are basically rpc all over again
i dont want an internet of things
i just want an internet on my pc
can someone try connecting to make sure it works
100.34.123.193
port 7777
it works
your pc is a thing bithc
you can judge whether or not a person works in it based on how they respond to "the internet of things"
thank you based extremely huge heavy cav provinces
if it's a scowl or a cringe, they are it
for protecting me from the terror of scales patala
lmao
if it's a gleeful laugh at how many security holes these fucking things have, it's a qa
ill be marignon
40 turn cata?
i had guys on manlifts updating our lightning fixtures
is the internet of things when a criminal can hack my fridge
yes
theres legit a throne
and then a chain of 3 heavy cav province
because the piece of shit lights had a nasty hole
stopping patala from rushing me
l m a  o
and were trying desperately to go join a botnet
lol
random events common, enabled story events because why not
and on the other side of the chain of heavy cav
is another throne
jsoh is this in la nights
ye
self replicating lightbulb based botnets are the future
if so be assured i am not rushing you
peace in our time
yeah you cant fucker
i have no opinion on cata
heavy cav to the rescue
if i wanted i probably would be assassinating the commanders r/n
peace in our time
i have just walked over all of the indies and lost two total troops so far
though i honestly did not check this turn
so it may have increased to three, or even four
.q add jsoh thank you based extremely huge heavy cav provinces
for protecting me from the terror of scales patala
quote added.
la owns its turn 5 and i have as much income as my turn 25 rus
jsoh you should fight ctis imho
my provs are poor as shit and terrible
oh scales patala
mine are absolutely fkin atrocious mainly
i get it.
i am the historical vikings who will be unruly and invasive because we live in a shithole and you dont
literally 1-3000 pop garbage
saem
i have three chokepoints sort of
i was going to immediately attack the person above me
but im also not gonna get more than 12
but its the one fucking nation that can hurt me
so rip
i fucked up my expansion twice
lol
alright start uploadin' pretenders
because its heavy cav everywhere wtf
done
lol if you lose a single troop to heavy cav
or take an affliction
wtf boing why are you taking provinces so close to my cap then
boing please do not say things like this to thirsty scales patala, the brutallest nation
bugger off with yuor dog
which thirsty is this
all
boing is my natural ally. our dogs will sniff eachother and be fast friends
all kinds
i have seized the high value provinces that are not my cap circle
also done
ill join if you timetravel 2 hours nito the past or make me have the day off tomorrow
with my powerful dog, while my idiot lizards smash into the same heavy cav province over and over again
are you doing the thicc lizards
because uhh
any nation that is even slightly worse than me is a natural ally
dont send them at heavy cav
the others are foes from the off
im going to get an early throne with tien chi, or ruin my expansion
literally 100% of the provinces in my cap circle are heavy cav
scales patala vs the world
wooow
im just hoping one of these swamps has an exposed gold mine or some shit
alas
4 people in
i think la ctis with fucked up expansion is maybe even weaker
or im going to be fucked if my third neighbor can also resist me
who we waiting on
also epic that i am next to the lighting bird throne that i will never take
no he has lazer dog
my pretender is done
yes the dog is powerful
oh you ahev a server up
i would have already attacked him if he didnt
im joining now
<@96715337440952320> i am excited to hear how your patala does
did you make a carto map
rando
not good i think but mercs are very useful for taking provinces for other people to take eventually
i will predict meksivik
dead by year three
@ me when turn 1 is up
scales patala wins by not being the first eliminated
if you die before scales patala, just remember that you are worse than that
ie every other monkey faction in that comedy awful dom 4 game
last call for blitz we got 5 ready to go
lanka and quadbless kailasa no match for the chakram
wait monkey you are totally in 172 rite
lemme know when you are ready cryle i think we will start when you are done
i don't know what 172 is
im not looking at it i am work
a forest with three river connections
no two
oops
ready
if it's a really fucked up piece of shit area with forests and swamp and rivers all over yeah that sme
i clicked on something or pressed something once that made a popup of province info appear with like a little paragraph of what the land type is and what connections it has
and have not been able to find it since
!details lanights

will take a second to generate and download map
who is agartha
also, guess what scales i took as utgard
cold 3? lol of course not
why do that when i could take heat 2 for 40 extra points? this plan could not backfire horribly as i am stuck in the middle of the fucking forested riverlands
can laserdog take this province
that province looks scary
also very rich
extremely.
that looks alarming
look at all those towns
is that hoburgdorf
that province is probably worth more than half of my land
all together
did you use carto
at alt4 he can do it probs
i have a longdead/ghouls/longdead horse province in my cap circle
its extremely sad
no just random
or if you attack from a lot of candles
it has 3 of his candles
im gonna do it from 2 candles.
everyone recieving the map image okay?
lol if your cap circle isn't pretty much solid longdead / ghouls / shit hole swamp
its in a forest so i think i might send a serpent priest along with my prophet to banihs it
i got them high upload speeds
for ez site search
it could go bad if they heroically do not route
yeah, got it
it actually went fast for the first time ever
leave laser dog in the very back corner and let the cav come to her probably
i will stand in one corner of the map so that if i rout i can waddle to the edge of the map
yeah
i got a second monitor rdy to go for maximum dom blitz chat
i recently got real human internet speeds
oh and people were saying lances are fucked up again
hmm i guess i can send a theurg too
multiple megabits
on the cyberspace
to try to find siteafter slaying million skeletons
can someone test and see if they reintroduced the lance charge bug by capping lance bonus based on str
still downloading here
cause that would be illwinter as fuck
whats the bug
light lances were getting full charge damage every turn supposedly
maybe also real lances?
lol
blank screen for me after selecting my nation
i didn't test and it's from idiots so maybe they are wrong or running an old version
it made cav nearly worth 46 rec each
indie strength set to 4, magic site rarity upped to 60
dling map image
i'm not 100% it was true
i think i in now
soon to be dling winter map image
the new bug jbrereton
from this version. someone with the game take light cav sacred and attack into heavy cav
and look at log
i will probably see this in a turn or two in surrounded
aka game of slander and recriminations
i jsut tested with 13 barbarian heavy horse
and none of them hit somebody more than once with a lance
what about light lance was it getting charge every time
that's the one they capped
they capped both
lance is strength extra as cap
light is half strength as cap
does that make xibalba spearbats really bad
<@120675876043096066> lets do this
everyone in their first turn?
does that bless help if they are recruit as elderly?
yes but they were already much worse than club ones
just about to take it
still dl'ing
ok odne
it made them more bad than they already were
on winter image mukip?
yeah
im in
ok light lance is not hitting any extra charge bonuses
just being used as a regular weapon after charge
ok good i will call this person a retard
oh lmao
it's zonk
:zonk:
were they specifically talking about sacreds
b/c im just using barbarian light horsies
maybe its broke for sacred
can you just copy the text of his post
light lance is the same weapon used by everyone pretty much
and first done done :toot:
<@120675876043096066> where ya at
ya weapons is weapons
ma blitz - ashdod, xibalba, marignon, r'leyh and machaka
taking bets now
rlyeh because it will put up bot and assassinate everything until everyone goes ai
send me your bitcoins giving 10:1 on xibalba
yeah its jsut
depends how old
sometimes
mekone, though, no
5 bonus damage on the charge and nothing else special at all zonks a dipshit
grats to the guy who presumably started next to what appears to be no less than 10 farmlands
its kind of silly that after a dude misses his charge
i hope someone started at 18
, 3 times ,
ashdod wins hands down
just farmland farmland throne farmland
his next try has 5 bonus damage
awake quickness blood surge done
oh i thought it lost the damage bonus if you miss
nah
haha
you keep the bonus damage until you hit something
just waiting on <@120675876043096066>
not all bad though, i started with construction 1
i started with
conj 1 enchantment 1
not bad
thaum, conj, alt, evoc and constr 1
will prophetizing a holy 2 guy get me a better prophet, r do they need h3
h3
h2 will just become a h3, h3 will become a h4, etc
i bet all of my bitcoins on them, and if they do not win i proclaim them bad
h3+ = +1 to holy
jerek is in a different game
<@!169456837236621312> jokes on you
they're probably gonna stale!!
which is impressive, in a blitz
.q add boing im the best
.tags boing
what the
what is their password
they are running next level advanced strats
gimme all your bitcoin nuclear
hah
that involve more than bless attack close
he said he would be here but alas
lmao
destroyed
a powerful feature
just messaged him
the blitz curse strikes again
wonder what their bless is
our contenders
nevermore is a good quote bot name btw
ban jerek
hes a good bot
jerek, playing dolphin
i am going to call him
ok i tested the exact situation zonk is claiming to be bugged
strong epithet game
and the result is: zonk is a retard
incoming
wooooo
curse broken
did u take uttervast
and sink all of your points in
uttervast is a pro ma strat
also somewhat appropriate??
uttervast is a fucking badass and if you make me play ma rlyeh i will run uttervast 100% of the time
time to dive into the exe to feature all the epithets from the water margin
sorry for the wait, everyone
it is okay friend
also a death 10 prince of death casting pale riders makes a fucking lot of skelemans
fear bless good
my favourite epithet has to be "the afterthought" in between "prince of arcane mysteries" and "the invincible and ever-triumphant""
b e v e r a g e
how many are we talking
a nail biter for sure
as a potentially interested pale rider caster
41
hmmm
replied, the other d10 pale rider future caster
what wonders await us in turn 2
45
really it's supposed to be 20+++
prince of death has reanimation bonus
oh
i have ring of sorc and could amulet of the dead it

so could prob hit 45
hmm
im not going to try that hard im just going to make 41 skeleton horse per turn until death gem is less than 10
did the turn go over
wow
y
that was an offensively bad return for site searching spells
and xibbalba is dead to me for no gimmick name
they have 10 mr too
overpowered
the game has turned
!details

and ragha also attacked me lol
a proper skeleton, with a light lance is indeed strong
oh darn it
i forget every game
a blitz with an uw nation
ok then
ill do it
ea rlyeh
just like
we'll forget you
i will play for probably fifteen turns
when we crush you underfoot
and then i will just stale the rest, because i won
so long as i get to be ea pan i will play in that game which will be over in 15 turns
man when i was in that game as ea r'leyh i was so confident i wouldn't be the first to die
jbrereton i have developed entropy two point zero
noooooo
my start sucks why did i start in a wasteland
hmm
p much a time trial between bot going up and pan throne win
instead of n he has e
a province has '8 light infantries' and thats it
i bet this is not a trap
show me entropy god
is it an uttervast
my start sucks why did i start in a wasteland
its a master lich with air and death and earth
oh ok
powerful
the best part is taking all of your death bless and converting it to undying
so you can expand better
do not try to cast fields of the dead with it
you will get as triggered as i did
it's bugged are they ever going to fix it
when your ench 9 spell literally doesn't work
it used to be ultra howl
ya
i can confirm that quickness increase the number of attacks per round more than 2x (as it is supposed to) in fact it seems like it is exactly 4x. i discovered that, because i had given my pretender sc items enough to have reinvigoration 6, and since her encumbrance was 3, she should have been fatigue neutral (actually decreasing in fatigue by 1 every turn because of the hidden 1 reinvigoration that all units get) after casting quicken self. 
she was not at all fatigue neutral and reached fatigue 100 before the battle ended. so i had a closer look at half speed. she attacked 4 times for each time reinvigoration took effect and she attacked 4 times as often as her enemiesÖ
is that actually true
who tested this
kris lighthawk
eh
ashdod
oh wait
no
lmao
yeah i dunno
that sucks
i bet she had two weapons
that is fucked up if true but i'm not sure how true it is
what is the weakest sacred i can put quickness on
sadly the battle replay being incredibly short does not help with debugging this stuff
vestals?
flaggelant
yeah flags
skopetsy
skopetsy.
also cap has 4 pco connections in total one of which is a throne
would be another alternative
fml
vestals have like 9 strength dont they
yes
flags f7w10s8 flags
flags!
they train in gymnastics but 10% less than a normal man
machaka what the hell
sorry to those who bet on marignon
my money is always on the fiery justice
it was probably fucking
i bet heavily on r'leyh
jerek did you take the correct bless
cold or hot outside and the guys just a retard
namely, w10
fuckin'
machaka
<@233383745779007499> trap sprung i have no idea what i'm doing lmao
it's grating that there is still no battle odometer and the replay window gets full from 2 attacks
so testing this stuff is actually not even simple
ok so ayar has
3 encumbrance
3 reinvig
me nether i am just makin' toads
do they not get double from flying
if i give him quickness bless and 2 reinvig bless he should be neutral
encumbrance wise
right
at leats i seduced a throne sorceress
i am next to a level 3 throne with 300 units and a monolith
alert
i think he will go up 6/turn maybe
it had a pyromance.r and he has red gems
r i p
because it's 6 encumbrance twice
its ok i sent a scout
i know the bullshit when i see it
swordsmen or pikes?
i might be wrong about fly enc double thing
he got well above 6
<@!169456837236621312> the ashdod is me
well how fast does a regular thing accumulate fatigue
try to forge weightless chain for them jsoh
like a 3 enc guy, no quick with 3 total reinvig
and other means of getting to less enc
3 enc guy with 3 total reinvig is neutral
theoretically. has anyone actually looked
his melee encumbrance is 3 and he has 3
i do not pay that much attention
well, 5 reinvig
ya but jsoh i think fliers get double but not listed
did you take quickness bless
he doesnt fly
oh right
.q "); print "i didn't escape user input properly"
for some reason thought ayar flew
awww
i did not, sadly
hes the guy whos gets power from not flying
ok he attacked once
then some enemies attacked
then he attacked again, etc
hes not double turning at all
lol somebody outbid me for the markatas
quickness = attack twice at the same time
i bid 99 on a 40 gold merc
well, hes not doing that
repel seems to be giving him fatigue
wait repel does that?
give him a mighty e n c h a n t e d  p i k e
and now it can't
how hard is it to keep track of a kraken
smh
hes got a length 4 weapon already on account of being tall
then who the fuck is repelling him
or is he tired from repelling other
ye
hes getting fatigue from knocking arms off while repelling swords it seems
ew repel making you tired means long weapons are bad on thug
im going to try with a dagon
but hes not fucking double attacking literally ever
oh fuck i lost a battle
woof
because machaka has the worst archers in the game, because they trick you into thinking they're not
do a w10 thing with length 0 weapons
machaka is p bad
like a dragon
the enemy things are getting in hits
build them big old spiderman
or attempts at hits
before he is
theyre more expensive than fants
dragon ahs too many attacks im not smart enough to follow
wow fuck that was way more of a gamble then i thought
or just do uhhh
the dwarf land thing
couldn't see the hydro or the sea trolls at all
linnorm
<@!160127200803160064>
wow
my scorpion king has a chest wound, are his days as an expander over
oh lmao no wonder
its a 14k pop underwater province
trying with erf snake
i am doing this with dagon and i can only say "results inconclusive"
haha i can't believe it actually worked
fucked up
q "); print "i didn't escape user input properly""
nah it'd be like
q "); print "i didn't escape user input properly"
space after close quote it didn't liek
doesnt seem to be doing anything
are you broken
hi bot
lmao does cold blooded get fucking penalties for it not being h1
yes
yes
+1 for neutral
+1/4/7/10
being a lizard sucks
the corpus logger is fine though
.q " ); print "i didn't escape my user input properly"
hmm
the discord api parser is smarter than i am
erf snek is gaining fatigue too
did it not allow that
with 2 encumbrance
and 4 reinvig
no repels
ok quickness is definitely working in terms of 2 attacks/round
how about no quickness
(or at least 2)
he should be dropping fatigue
like just enc2 reinvig2
is it actually neutral
he should be better than neutral
ill see
it may just be reinvig is slower than attacks
and quick makes it twice as bad
i think reinvig is only 1/turn
ya
if i knew discord or really coding at all i could probably do something nefarious
but :effort:
reinvig inc 1/turn natural reinvig is one per turn
whereas attacking twice incurs 2 fatigues
yeah
highest is aw his fatigue at was 11 tho
doesnt make sense
nooooooo
they are tough
and sacred
dagon was at 9 fatigue after double attacking/casting temper flesh at start of fight w/2 reinvig bless and standard +1
if r'leyh had a better way to manage summons
.tag conot sinister hacker
they would be so much better
and he double attacked quite a lot
like, they more reliable summons
again total lack of battle odometer is a problem here
2 reinvig hes holding at 2 fatigue as the max
to be fair
regularly summoning vastnesses would be
i think at least
incredibly fucked up!
rude

even if i turn my phone sideways
if your diplomacy is more than an unannounced entry into their territory you do not understand blitz
now the bot is more sensitive if you call him bad
not naming the robot after a cia/nsa surveillance op is some shameful shit tbh
hello friend
i see your virtue
if you come and slay me then nobody will ever be able to stop r'leyh
piot
make the bot ignore conot
[6:17 pm] jsoh: not naming the robot after a cia/nsa surveillance op is some shameful shit tbh
good point. name the bot discord
im working on functionality to make the bot selectively ignore people it doesnt like
.q add jsoh not naming the robot after a cia/nsa surveillance op is some shameful shit tbh
samog - today at 12:18 am
good point. name the bot discord
damn i gotta turn that off
.q jsoh
make everyone use compact mode
solar weapons triple damage against demons/undead also triples the targets fire resistance. for example, solar weapons used against demons with fire resistance 10, roll -21 + drn vs half armor (armor piercing) + drn. instead it should be rolling -1 + drn vs half armor (armor piercing)+drn. the fire resistance is tripled along with the solar weapon 3 ap attack.
so all of the quotes look like this
person a: setup
person b: punchline
lol what jsoh
that's a great bug
i dont know how to even parse this
if you add a quote that says
person a: setup
person b - today at 8:52 pm
punchline
yuo are assuming its true nuclear monkey!
rallying against poor innocent 2d anime girls
you should be brutally slain
if you attack a demon with 5fr it will be 9ap vs 15 if it's true
zonk responded to me saying hes wrong with "i was looking at multiple horsemans lance attacks"
thats obviously just an order of operations thing
isnt it
but he cleverly noticed that if you miss your charge you get to try again
so glad he was a very vocal beta tester
.q jsoh
i fixed it
ty
not if the roll says that its rolling vs 3 times his fire resist
thats very good actually.
good work boing.
have a gold coin
cool things about discord audit log: i can isolate by any user other than myself

whats a good way to get demons with 5 fire resist
lanka i guess?
xibalba
what did i say about the ocean
lol my men crossed a river
attack lanka yeah if it's true you should have some bonkers rolls
doing like 30 damage on a swing
and then my heat 3 set in
and now they are trapped in a corner of the map forever
rip
oh in 12?
rip
i never even thought about adding quotes from compact mode, fuck
actually in 1
i gotta write a whole different parser.
my scales got to 12 so fast i can simply never enter it
the ocean belongs to me, and no other
lankas troops dont have negative fire resist hey
oh i see that
lmao
just commanders
do you want me to put the edomites out of their suffering or
does it triple fire vulnerability as well
noooo they are my only friends
commanders and summons
the correct lazy answer is to mod militia to have 5 fr and be demons with no movement
also i attacked someone who had ko oni pd
they bought like 5 pd i dont know why
and they routed, because there were no demon leaders, which hp routed him instantly
we were greeted as liberators is what im saying
lol
thats good.
wish we could get <@188392419635494912>  back in the game now that utgard, bringer of stale turns is banished to the void

so is the shark night :black101:
if you hit them it should be 9ap fire vs 15 fr if he's right
the roll is alwys -6 vs +1
is that how it does it. just subtracts fr from damage
9 - 15 = 6
pretty fucked up
illwinter as heck
hmm
yeah maybe its that lmao
https://puu.sh/z9020/6a4bc9fcf3.jpg

how to win any dominions battle:
mass fligh + weapons of sharpness
even militia will murder everything w/ that combo
they wont kill the mass flight fog warrior army of gold vanheres
fair
ichtyids are literally the worst
so probably
yes they will
because there will be like 5x as many
and everyone is dying to magicks at that point anyway, so a ponyman will get zapped just as easily as dumb human

(quietly) this guy thought homero was an alligator.
i odnt know.
hello everyone, i'm a new member here and also a fairly new player of dominion ( 5 and 4 ), and i love the game a lot, it's really a unique take on a strategy game, and so far it's also one of the only one ive seen that centers most of it's gameplay around " religion "

as such, ive decided to browse the community for all kinds of mods, and played a bit of some faction, but the one i had my eyes on before i started playing was r'lyeh, because i'm a huge h.p lovecraft fan, even though i havn't read any of his work, it's just the design of cthulhu and the other old ones that sparks interests in my eyes.

i sadly realized however that r'lyeh is not that fun of a faction to play as, atleast in my opinion. i feel they lack on the " otherwordly " feature, the creatures from other dimension feel that i kinda hoped to get when playing it ( r'lyeh from la, which is the closest to the cult of cthulhu feel ive been wanting )

i'm speaking of this but i've not played them that long, in fact i didn't finish the party i had going mostly because the freebie units swarmed every single of my province and i had no utility for them.

as such i decided to ask someone to mod a rework / entirely new faction of r'lyeh, which would be much more centralized around being from other world, enslaving populations, nightmares, etc... which i feel we're one of the main points i couldn't get while playing them ( again i havn't played as them that long, i did maybe a 30 mins / 1 hour game before quitting out of frustration, so if i missed any of the points i talk about up there somehow, do correct me about it. )
this guy rules.
make him a bespoke mod, <@317410996169736204>
he spent more time writing that post then figuring out how rlyeh played
fuck
so salty
ry'leh would be cooler if it was a land nation that instead of cap-only summons had underwater-only summons
so you want to just dive in asap
but also, you are a land nation, and therefore, not immune to the game
i was going to make a mod that made basically all of the water breathing items cost one gem
for personal, and like 5 for an army
but water is a piece of shit and the minimal effort required is not worth it
this mod would also make fucking water things move two provs
why would you make this a thing that you could do and explicitly make tritons and stuff slow enough where it never happens
ya tritons should have like 35 map move
so they can do 3 prov
yes
i was going to set all aquatic tritons to 3 and mermen to 2
stuff that walks on the bottom stupidly should move 1, not faster than swimmers
cool now just make more than 6 spells castable underwater and you have a corker of the mod
oh also autocast sea of ice on turn 1
was also going to add a 1f water breath item
and change amulet of the fish to 1w
#woah
basically for water to be less shit the barrer between the two should be way weaker
yes
but also
right there is a problem with this because
if you reduce the barrier initially, they just gain bonus fuck up the land nation powers
this is something me and sumwon grappled with in beta
well they don't get better troops or more amphibiousness, just the items are cheaper to make for everyone involved
but fundamentally "a spell so water nations can use their amphib shit on land eventually" should be in the game
does earth power stop working if you levitate
what does that spell do
+1e
no the mod one jbrereton linked
i think everyone who has played dominions for more than an hour knows what earthpower does lol
and no it just works no matter what
it is a global monkee
which any uw nation can cast, and puts a site that lets them create their aquatic units as amphib ones in their forts
and if it does down that site disappears
that is the cleanest i could do it myself
it might not have the right rec points for nowadays since it was made at like 4.92 as a "here is something you could already do please do it" mod for illwinter
really intended for it to be similar to thetis' blessing but in reverse but that is not something a humble normie can code in
summon earth power is usable by fliers and levatators cryle
what they're actually going to do is give all the atlantis mermen [promote] and into a form that has legs and breathes air
they are apparently doing nothing whatsoever to make uw good after the revolutionary underwater improvement patch that let ea rlyeh recruit grandmothers outside of forts
i guess i will take that spell and incorporate it
and spend 15 gems to make one of their mages much worse and put their astral path on land, on a 5 year max age package
which mod was it that had acidify the oceans
magic enhanced
that is good shit
ok i guess ill download that and pull in some of the fuck the ocean spells too
because there is an extreme lack of ocean fucking in vanilla
did it add any uw castable fire spells too or will i have to do that myself
because fire should at least have *something*, even if it's bad
ill probably change boil to just be fire
and make it... not so fucking bad
boil should be a remote attack
steampunk human f/w nation with diving armor and they get a national discount on barrels of air
boil the ocean as a remote and just boil as combat
like you stand next to the water and boil everyone in the prov alive
yes
actually wait no, just make that a merc company
i wanted to make boil the ocean like fires from afar except is also popkills
because fuck the ocean.
really
fuck you, ocean
is there a way to equip the summoning pretender for ma ryleh to fight greater horrors so it can get them as sacreds
i accidentally won against a big molecule guy and it was fun throwing him at provinces
horrors will never join you
you can either kill them, or they kill you
vastness is a bro
oh dang
vastness joins you tho
my neighbor uttervasto
isn't he a horror?
no
uterrvast is uttervast
dang
vastness is vastness
horrors are like, horror, gore tide, mind slime, dream eater
the only shared trait between horrors is they fucking hate everyone, including other types of horrors and will attack them forever
they will never flee and must be killed
ah
monkee https://www.dropbox.com/s/p7j5vk2mpib68tc/landrec_d5.zip?dl=0 <- this is land rec mod for dom 5
i remember one time my mage got visited by a pile of eyeballs and blinked for 50 rounds before walking up and kicking it to death
which again should be vanilla functionality imo
(adds inland recruitment for uw nations)
those suck. the only void creatures worth a shit are elder things, vastness, thing that should not be and greater otherness
yeah
is it possible to have a bless build with ma ryleh
anything is possible
will it be good? no
i guess when you talk abt uw nations its a can of worms
kremath there is 1 bless build with ma rlyeh
blood vengeance to stack on top of dr, and regen
the only bless that matters is arcane finesse
which you always get
because it makes shroud into +1pen
plus finesse ya
are your mind blasters sacred?
no
no
your only sacred is starspawn priest
and some void summons
also, powerfully, indie sacreds
there should be a mod that makes it so every upgraded uw fort has an abyssal well site or something
i think it's probably okay for water nations to not get good stuff inland
they should get coast for sure
but land gets shit all in the ocean too
there is normally like 2-5x as many inland provs as water and coast
idk
maybe make the water breathing global cheaper/easier to cast/more paths
yeah but as long as you make stuff on coasts you just concentrate it there and move around as needed
like if you grab the entire ocean and every coast plus maybe a few land beyond that
you gonna be huge, and powerful. and should be planning throne grab
fwiw i think land nations all getting guaranteed uw stuff would be fine also
.markov
.markov land nations
ok.
fuck the ocean. land should just have an easier time of exterminating the ocean
maybe make some amber clan if you care to
and ignore it forever aside from income besides that
i mean you could add indie merman scouts and maybe even w1 mages to their poptype and it would be fine i think
but yes acid sea should also def be in the base game
though some nations should
like patala gets water naga
so when you are inevitably banished to the ocean, you can make things there
same for ma xibalba
#selectnation 98
#uwcom1 "consolation naga chief"
to represent being water naga they would be grosser looking and weaker
bobbit worms with naga faces
agreed, no hypnotize also
yellow bellied sea snake naga
i like jomon where they have good troops underwater but no way of getting there
bc they're idiots
they can be more venomous but without hypnotize
"after the incident, john attempted to generate money from his renown by forming a band, the severed parts, to pay his mounting medical and legal bills, although the band was unsuccessful and failed to generate enough money."
nice
<@255835336083636234> what did you use for hosting? python anywhere?
oh nvm yours is written in something else
yeah, just an aws server. you can use that for python too, but it's a bit more complicated
you get a year free though which is cool
ok i'll check it out
.markov scales patala
hmm.
a nation so powerful it defies emulation
something in the corpus broke the decoder
nah jbrereton is probably right
the bot was simply rendered speechless by the majesty of scales patala
.markov
ok so its the server
works fine when hosting on my local pc but not on this cloud service that i spent money on.
i am going to make them sannyasa naga who reject the materialistic regular naga
with their jewels and shit
i was briefly making a good monkey la nation that lived in comical air bubbles and was brought down by friendly kinnara
crab spearing markata and all
i will give them a quarterstaff instead of a spear
.markov
have them eschew weapons perhaps
but have awe due to üôè
you're not selling, you're buying
they will have walking sticks i guess represented as a quarterstaff
water shape no weapon at all
hilariously enough that would mean they have better combat stats on land cause quarterstaff owns
or maybe a bone spear
that'd be easier. just give them a bone spear no hypnotize
.markov scales patala
dammit.
it is too powerful
ok its just because i dont understand how git works
.markov scales patala
there.
i have successfully hosted a bot in the cloud
.markov blessrush ma ryleh
it only has a couple days worth of corpus
nobody has blessrushed ma ryleh yet.
i want n gems
remember to post inconguous yet lyrical things for the bot to repeat
also nobody has probably misspelled rlyeh as ryleh yet
.markov jbrereton
do you offer payment plans
. markov ryleh
yeah, i plan for you to pay me in exchange for gems
.markov ryleh
know what would be neat
duplicate nations
thats a fast fuckin way to figure out where you balance problems would be (also ermor wars)
that was done a lot in dom4
all ea ermor game all nazca game i think there were more
it makes sense, that when pangaea wins in ma, presumably they populate the whole world and nobody remembers where 'pangaea' really is
so a bunch of pretenders show up all swearing that their sacred grove is the real pangaea
p sure that with very few exceptions all the nations are an east india company type deal where they just use the humans' preexisting tax programmes and census data for the benefit of an extremely foreign pretender god
hell yeah
the bad boys of turntaking ride again
i found out from the bug report thread
ok so it's known
wiped lol
apparently merrels or whatever are pretty ghood
if a pretender has both #triplegod x and #gemprod y 1, and if that pretender is dormant or imprisoned, when the god will wake up, one of the three trinity members will start with 1 gem as normal, but the two others will start with a number of gems equal to the number of turns from the begining of the game.

why is the nazca timer fifty seven hours
who is hitler. i demand to know
can size 6 trample size 5
actually would it even matter, since there's just 1 thing in the tile anyways?
someone convince jomon to go ai
yes
they can
and it matters because you trample more than one square
does haste make you trample more things in a turn?
probably
it gives you more combat speed
yes
and it also gives charge bonus.
isn't there that winged head bull god that has air magic and trample?
i think i am finally owned in nazcagame
sorry for being slow again, i should be home in time to finish up this turn pretty soon
i no longer remember when or why this war started, year 2 i guess. in the grim darkness of turn 48 there is only hellwar

i'm very confused as to how you got to that province
your god doesnt even have mountain survival
is ethereal crossbow + eye of aiming a good assassin
oh but i guess he would have in the previous province
like, shoot a guy, and they die. because you have 20 precision
and it always kills
or is banefire crossbow better
i am crushed w the burden of choice
just cast skeletons
oh fuck me.  i drunkturned the wrong global.
it doesn't always kill
you need to beat mr don't you
https://twitter.com/classiclib3ral/status/956256786465640450/photo/1
lol
!details

im doing it. im making the ethy xbows
!details

i told you guys pan and ermor were working together! but you never listened!
gem deal still stands if anyone is interested
why is absum black
seems fitting
why
y tho.
god samog
you can't just ask people why they're black.
ethereal crossbows might run into issues if they have bodyguards
well, not really, but this the channel is the place for declaring imaginary alliances
they don't, at least this turn
im giant hunting
and next turn i can equip with bottles of living water, too. which will deal w/ baby bodyguards or slow down giant body guards enough for the crossbowman to hopefully kill them
that'd do it
you know ethereal crossbow doesnt do anything if they win the mr check right
and then you sit there reloading for a round
is that bad
is banefire xbow better
i mean if you want to assassinate gyjas, what do you bring
golden arbalest?
what
its much better
isnt it just a crossbow
it fires twice a round
and has 10 precision
and does ap damage
all crossbows do ap damage
don't try to assassinate gygja probably
that's a terrible plan
well i dont want to fight them!
what about bow of war
theyre astral
just magic duel them
with a cheaper mage
oh wait that's only a % of them
well you can magic duel those ones
disaster has struck my doggo took an affliction
which one
neverheal
ive never magic dueled
not even bad
is it just 50% who wins
he was one province away from finishing expansion with none though!
it is if they have the same astral level
it's drn+astral level
on both sides
roll a d6 on each side + astral level
tie both die
magic duel will work, however he will just ball up the ones without s
and kill you with them probably
if he does that, mindhunt them
some dude tried that on my jotuns as pythium and that's exactly what happened
i am looking for "this turn" solutions
roll over, die, and go ai
i never ai
it would reduce my supply of turns
which nation are you
ea ermor
oh
just cast heat from hell
i assume you have heat 3
yeah i got evo 5 this turn
heat from hell is ench6
ill have it in two turns
i guess i could just sit in the fort. he cant siege it. its not my capitol.
if he brings hurlers the walls go down in one turn
is it just popsicles and grammas
he brought 15+ sacred guys, 6 gyjas, 2 jarls, uhh, some humans
the big frosty boys
lol what a fukkin joke
heat from hell cast fire ele a few times and you win
my current plan is: assassins assassinate stuff, i cast breath of hte desert and attack
that is not a good plan
that will result in: dead assasins
wasted gems
don't you have h3
no
h1
you done fucked up
im not ruining my scales!!
i guess you have to breath your own land
does it instantly set the province to h3?
when you have shittons of fire magic heat is not ruining your scales
it's making you more powerful
isn't it a -30% income for every province for the entire game
no
it's -15%
that is huge
except, temperature is seasonal
so no, it's not actually that
wow so sometimes, for like, three turns, its -10
it extremely does not matter
there is a reason good players always have either neutral or an extreme
3 ticks for points, or if you want cold (snowshoe) or heat (fire wizards, cold blood)
fire elementals and heat stun + burning are far more powerful in h3
if you light a niefel on fire in heat 3, it never goes out
until it's dead
your heat auras are +1 aoe per heat scale
and heat fatigue from heat from hell is stronger
fire eles have heat power and have better stats
oh right
i forgot to mention
+2 enc to all enemies in your dominion, which is either cancelled natively for you because your wizards have fr, or is easily cancelled by buffing it
its late spring, and the siege starts next turn
so, it'll be early summer +2h
is the fort full of wizards
its got uhh, i think 6 or 7
3 elder thaums with flame skulls or skull staffs
babby ones or str
depending
and 4 babies
well as long as you have level 5 fire ele and heat from hell it'll be fine
do you have any chaff
if not make like 2 dozen gladiators
some fire emelentals will destroy probably
since thats like skeletons
those guys : they are gunna use skeletons at you
yes
i have
neither of those
skeletons are real bad vs ethereal stuff that kills you for trying ot hit it
rip
well get fire ele first
its like turn 30
if you spam those hard enough you win without heat from hell
turn 30 you should have both, for a while
im going ot have alteration 5 before the end of year 1 i think in this game
even after throwing away 2 mages
must be nice to play games with cowards who don't ea xib rush you on turn 3
its nice to not play with ea xibalba ya
well you aren't dead so that's something
as ea ermor, at turn 30
so whether you win or lose you did fine
hey whos the guy from popular culture (maybe shakespeare i think its that guy at least) who sits in the bushes while someone else calls up to the lady in the balcony feeding her lines to seduce her with

do the tattoos make ulm any better?
marv you mean i thyink
i thought sauro, marv, and ulm got blesses
but i've never checked ulm
not blesses. tats
gath is not bad
if this is a badnations list
lol you're not suffering under the jackboots of pythium while you have me bottled up in my cap
dingus
no ulm
tats is just marv and sauro
<@!169456837236621312> he has absolutely nothing but gyjas, jarls, his sacreds, and some human chaff
my stone huaca has a limp
do they have gear with fire resistance on any in the front
are they niffle jarls or jotun jarls

the blue ones
sniffle jarls
oh wait
jotun jarls, sniffle giants
maybe he has a big fr bless?
jotun jarls do not get lit on fire quite so hard
they're still going to be 5 points out of their element right
its 2 cold
they like cold 3
so if its heat 2 they will be extremely encumbered unless they have hot resist
its 2 points of fatty per bad scale right
i dont remember honestly
what is this list, is a badnations game in the planning stages?
its the old bad natons list maybe kind of updated to dom5
it would be fun to have a game with ea, ma, and la abysia in it
and by fun i mean terrible
jsoh i send you my stuff when i die in nazca right
will you defeat mukip for me
probably not
i could try tho
can a pretender die on a march from being crippled
2001 do not read
no
commanders cant die of it
they just get extremely reduced map move
lol if the army just deserts by marching briskly until their commander falls behind/dead
basement stairs the godslayer
if he's smart enough to bring a fire ele this could happen though https://i.imgur.com/swsvkqt.png
he can wolven winter to drop your heat and just grip + rigor and you lose once the time runs out
cause those together are a lot of fatigue per round and fire eles are cold weak
what's the cast range on ww
3 times?
like 5 but you can extend it
or he can just drop illwinter and perma cold 3 the planet
which i assume he wants to do at some point
i want to play a game as xibalba just to steal the sun and have someone else have to make a new one
it never happens
stealing the sun is as common as casting utterdark or celestial rainbow
<:rip:372893660963930112>
i can't figure out why my thugs routed
if hes been running around with 6 gyjas all game how likely can it be his research is any good?
i tested and retreated 1 dude out of 4 and the 3 stayed
all he needs is ench6
grip rigor and skelespam
<@332710960554835988> we will tear each other to shreds!
if its turn fucking 30
6 gyjas are not going to be an imposition
that made me laugh more than it should have
six sounds pointless yes
probably would just need one and a jarl
plus the chaff garbage
maybe a couple extra
wait wait
can i teleport into his army with a +3s guy, magic duel him, and then do returning and go home?
err
can i teleport into his army with a +3s guy, magic duel him, and then do returning and go home?
is that a thing
magic duel is 100 fatigue
i'd knock off their last few territories, but i've got a big army heading my way
returning is s2 and needs 2 gems.  so if you give them 4 gems then they could burn one to reduce the fatigue cost of magic dual then gtfo?
...or they're already s2 and they'll already reduce it.  derp
s3
you need s3 to teleport
welp, magic dual fatigue shouldn't be a problem üòÉ
having an extra skill level means the mage suffers only ¬Ω fatigue, two extra skill levels means he suffers only 1/3 as much, three extra is ¬º, and so forth.
so magic duel would be 50 fatigue
and returning is 200 but who cares, you're safe now.
or, uhh, 100
i should do this with my pretender, hes an s5 divine emperor
does ring of returning occur before or after you take 90 damage from a giant punching you in the entire body
after
welp
why would you have a s5 divine emperor
that pretenders so fucking bad
eyes of god!!!
its the best
you can pick a great enchantress and get the same paths
for the same cost
and you lose 1 rank of dominion
in exchange for having shoes
and +1 pearl a turn
or a great sage for a insanely indulgent like what 20 points more
hes got extra pockets!!
shoes are better than pockets most of the time
crone gets pockets and shoes!
right now hes got a bird leaf, a skull, and a lantern. hes so smart.
see a great sage
might take the lantern off
has like +20 research for not any gems
and also ameks everyone else in the same province read gooder
much better
idk maybe??
i made this guy like a month ago, and i had no idea wtf i was doing other than "i like eyes of god and i want a bunch of blesses"
i guess if ur ermor you maybe get a discount on that guy
hes 80
but still its a lot better to take any other guy
8 dom
so you save a lot on that last candle
sure but it doesnt do much for you
more knights!!
can you make 8 knights
yeah
barely
8 every turn
since like turn 9
thats actually impressive what kind of scales do you have wtf
uhh 3o 3p
ermors overpowered.
i dont know waht my scales are
i would much rather make 4 temples to get that extra holy point than spend that many design points on it
you get holy points from temples?
ya
every 5 temples is +1 up to a max of ten
it gives al lof the benefits of dominion strength
42 design points for a dom2 base to go from 7-8
seems not worth ot me
so marveni should build temples everywhere??
i should prob start doing that in my marveni game
why
more candles, duh
i mean, generally its good
we just went over this
except if someones going to come along and gank your temples
having a shitload of temples in not forts is a huge incentive for me to come knock down all your things

becaues it shows me you spent a bunch of gold on things that dont stop me from taking your things, and also allows me to hurt you more than just regular raiding would without also having to bring something big enough to take a fort
you're gonan look at that, and say "why the fuck do u only have 1e"
and im gonan say "someone told me to get 1e"
you probably had 10 points left over or something
yeah
1e would be a lot better if he had feet
fuck feet man
he has 6 feet
tfw 6 feet and u cant wear shoes
if you were going to have a pretender like that again i woudl suggest taking growth 3 and paying for it with misfortune 2 and heat 2
or something like that.
growth is very strong
yeah next time i would get heat 3
since im basically using all fuckin fire magic
oh uhh
do banefire bolts or darts or wahtever, work with -fr
no
banefire is untyped damage
!spell banefire
<@282646158218756116>: https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/?page=spell&spellq=banefire&showmodcmds=1&showmoddinginfo=1&showids=1
it wont melt sniffle giants
they wont light on fire no
but it will sitll do af ucking lot of damage
bane fire and to a lesser extent bane fire darts entire thing is they just do a shit load of unresistable damage
and ruin anyones day
the spell "bane fire" does 55 damage
good to know
theres no resist on it , but prot can reduce it, but it halves all prot because its armor peircing
shadow blast good?
so like, a cold 3 niffle giant will roll 55 vs 21
err
55 vs 10
i think thats how it works at least
acutally is cold prot natural protection fuck idk
the bad boys of thaumaturgy are gonna be d3/d4 so it would be a size 8 blast
yeah its pretty strong
but not so much vs giants they have high mr ithink
neifel giants 15 mr, gyja 17
yeah its nuts
my first plan was etheral xbow assassination
bane fire is good for murdering thme in one shot
assassins dont do well vs death mages
i got banefire darts. probably no banefire for a few more turns
they're scripted to enlarge and bless before starting skelespam
gygja are not sacred
and uhh
nobody follows scripts in assassin fights anyway
o
and the ai loves making skeletons
thats not true: defenders dont follow scripts
assassins do
if its head 2 nifel giants have like milita level attack adn dfense scores and bad prot also
but are still really strong with lots of hp
they will die to fire balls
i can do fire balls
i can do a lot of fire balls
were temp gem gen items per turn or per battle? do they work for multiple battles in a turn?
is fire cloud any good?
i can do that too but it seem , ehh?
maybe just have one guy doing it?
i think fire cloud is prob better than fire ball
there was a patch note awhile back about making clouds hit dudes more often
in this case because large single targets fire balls might be better
fire cloud is my go to evo to spam as fire against skeles though (if you are not spamming fire eles for some reason)
they'll probably switch to fire cloud when the scripting ends anyways
jerek have you considered selling me nature gems
the only thing limp about my god is his limp dick bless
so my neef solution seems to be in place (the solution is balls of fire)
now just gotta deal w ethereal retard agartha and im all set

yomi in 3 games
yw
how does a man sink so low
you may not like it, but this is what peak oni performance looks like
you have a huge advantage conot
in stupid robot
in that your god is bugged : (
and also im very stupid and have a bad bless
why do you have a temple in every province you owe. why was i just able to walk in and destroy 3 temples and a lab
before anyone fought me
hows the god bugged
the fire resist vs solar weapons thing
his god has innate fire resist and then more from fire paths
so i hit it and it does 0 damage from solar weapons unless i roll exceptionalyl well
instead of like 4
oh
he has like 11 , so he effectively has like 45 prot
against solar weapons
when he should ahve 21
what do you mean why do i have a temple in every province
it's yomi
yeah you dont get any benifit from having temples in places that are not mountains
except the regular temple benefits ofc
mountains and highlands and forts
nnnno, all temples summon oni
no
they dont
unless theres a oni boss in them
i have one in a swamp in 2001
or they are in those terrains
summoning oni
is it a border mountain swamp
if thats actually hapepning its not working as designed i believe
did anyone tell cryle that some cursed items are picked up after combat but others are ont
hmm
ok you are right its giving me onis in every provinec
maybe im misinformed or thats broken
maybe the reason im so bad at yomi is i have no idea how yomi works!
the truest yomi strat
as to why no one was there to fight you
my main stack was fucking around on the other edge when some dickhead decided to aggro me üò†
my bless fucking sucks+ is also bugged to be nonfunctional basically against your nation so im dead i think lol
i mean even without any bugs, all oni are fire resistant so
yeah but
effectively 15 fire resist compare to effectively 5
jsoh's bless, for reference
[12:21 pm] jbrereton: actually temples everywhere spawn onis but mountains and highlands = double pace unless they changed that when they took out swamp namanaris
fair
though unless you're fuckin' hurting for gold theres still no real reason to not build temples everywhere
freepop is freepop
also trying to do turns by teamviewer is the fuckin' worst
ugh
jsoh i have a feeling about weapon blesses
which is that they do not always proc and indeed can sometimes not proc at all if you have multiple
b/c it feels like you get for say 2 blesses 2x 50% chance of them going off
what's the proc rate then?

does a mage who dies in his lab while holding an item still get buried with it
no now it goes to lab
so he can take his starshine skullcap to the afterlife or whatever
not sure, if they die of disease they throw it in a lab
thats good
automatically. extreme qol increase
idk if he gets killed by an arrow or someshit but definitely with disease
do assassins steal items from the mages they murder
just lol if you never endured dom3 machaka at least once manually managing fever fetish on a large stable of spider commanders, named by month and year
lol
sagely: that is my fetish
it owned. you named them by year-month that they would die of disease assuming you picked up never healing wound
you would remove it if they did, or rename them to their no never healing wound death turn
you did this, forever and forged more all the time
it just gets progressively worse to manage until you are mercifully eliminated or the game ends
gemgens sound fun
in general, not in particular.
at least the others were fire and forget. you just pushed pool every turn
fever fetish was a special hellish case
impressive that they had a 'pool gems' button back then
i dont remember when that was added but it i remember its presence
but genuinely it sounds like lategame dominions where everyone has hundreds of gems per turn is peak dominion
the blood hotkeys did not exist yet
you could pool slaves, but the suck everything to this commander province didn't exist. you had to manually move every blood slave onto the scout
good, fuck blood
it wasn't as strong hilariously enough
because with clam spam and easier access to level 9 magic, if there was a blood person in the endgame you just armageddoned nine times or so and they were done
even blood guys had to clam spam so that you had the ability to wish for slaves
wish: war crimes

wow jb. can't a guy sacrifice a bunch of stupid trolls without retaliation
lol holy shit. 20k died in a plague
you have a 2n retard. do you want to cast sleep cloud or panic?
you want to cast the creeping doom, really
wise dom player: uhh actually you want to cast this really nifty thaum 9 spell or whatever.
atlanton i hope we can work together constructively in future
thats not even 2n! its 3n!
aaaaaaaaaaah
but 1 gem
you speng
65 bugs ftw
what is it you are fighting that you are thinking of panicking/sleeping
heres my situation: i like using gifts from heaven and i dont particularly like my stargazers. so now i have no stargazers
salamanders and burning ones
haha oh boy
prob sleep
it might bust their armor right
did you cast black plague on me or something?
it sounds like a coincidence to me m8
uh huh
like mainly you don't want to miss and panic your no doubt much more cowardly own troops
i have paved a road to his capitol, with dead communion slaves
when the stargazers died i used my gutaters, and with the gutaters dead im looking real hard at these 1s druids..
have you cast the powerful spell "personal regen" with a communion master
its not my fault gifts generates a lot of fatigue
rip
you should have communions the druids together
with fatigue calcs instead of getting a 4x multiplier divided out it would have been much lower
they could have used gifts a lot more heavily without deaths
i had 8 stargazers once
stargazers should be built into soul slay or cascades spam squads
stargazers don't have e magic cryle
so they take mega fatigue from gfh
i mean they still work but you need a lot to divide the fatigue up
normally you kind of want your most diverse + strong mages as the slaves if at all possible
so you're saying its their fault for being stupid
not 8. 8 are gonna die unless it's like 1 master
yes
i had, uhh, i think 8 slaves on probably like 6 druids/elders
i remember when all druids were elder druids
it was great
for about 5 rounds
so you could have them all casting gifts on their own
then it was just 6 druids and all the stargazes died
it was great. i miss dom3
lets make these the most beautiful 5 rounds of our lives.
do ritual castings still go in province number order
like if you are as an example patala right you probably want your 4xx1 mages as the slaves so you can cast whatever you like and maybe not even die
it goes in order, but chooses randomly between top to bottom and bottom to top
oh jesus
get fucked shitlord
with e1s1 slaves your epower puts them to e2s1 and they can support gifts spam ez
or even more excellently, epower and pots on another guy
it's how geomancers work
yeah
basically you want the level disparity from e3 to be as low as possible to diminish fatigue
and then if possible get an n1s1 mage to cast personal regen as another handy buffer
cryle do you have some anti abysia troops like the angry guys w/ a huge axe or is this pathetic javelin time
b/c if so destruction will be v handy
i greatly outnumber him
and i can cast rain
that will do *checks notes* uhhh nothing
nothing at all
the fire shield still works. they still punch the same
against abyssia?
yeah.
yes
it makes their heat shitty kinda
it literally says "this reduces their heat"
it makes heat less toxic for you. it makes their spells harder to cast
that won't save you thoguh
that's it
whats going to save me is gifts from heaven
if you're dying to being set on fire vs being punched, it will have been a really weird fight
i would have probably just spammed destruction personally cause it's cheaper and i would go straight alt 5 as marverni
why
okok heres the master plan: 2 druids slave up, 2 elders + 1 druid master. the druid casts rain. the other druids do earthpower and gifts. another elder druid teleports in and does light of the north star and gifts.
gifts is insanely unreliable
if you have like 1 dude casting it
or not crazy high precision
and my pig casts bladewindx4 then earthquake just in case
but see. bladewind would own with destruction
yeah in retrospect?? i guess??
and assuming you have an assload of humans, destruction makes all of them hit really hard
of yeah. if you don't have destruction, then nvm
are water elementals weak in heat scales
do they have fr
they have fr and are amazing against fire things
although, they aren't frozen and don't have protection in heat scales
not being frozen is okay
yeah. it's better imo
they have damage resists in warm form
but they'll still get punched is what i mean
ya although ice ones would get the most punched
due to trampling and proccing like 20 attacks from every surrounding square if they haven't attacked yet that turn
hmm i dont know if that works

what does liquid body do again?
i guess it works if you @mention people but it doesnt register that they are the same
turns your body liquid
i might fix that if i have time.
how suprising
slash, blunt, pierce res + afflicton resist at the expense of movement speed and strength
it's good
ah... so water elementals have that innately. v good illwinter
they have liquid bodies, atlanton
tfw when you cast liquid body on an ice elemental but it doesn't turn into a water elemental
it's a slurpie elemental
ya slush elemental
it turns into this http://www.thevapeshop.co.uk/e-liquid/ice-e-liquid-flavours

freak lord: i have created a man with five necks, so that he may drop more slave collars upon death
modnation idea: those grey dudes from sockbaby.
so im fucking with my arena mod but i'm very dumb. can i just edit the normal arena event
and set it to fire automagically every year late winter
no
#selectevent does not work
can i delete that one then
you can delete every single event and artisinally hand code them all other than that one back
game is bad
tell me about it
i can't even find the fucking event what is the id
i did ask when they did the cataclysm thing if we could get a more reliable way to trigger the arena and maybe have a victory condition based on the # of wins there
searched arena, tournament
get this monkee
it isn't a regular event
dominions is like a good brie, in that it is covered with some gross tough stuff that you spend like 10 minutes trying to chip off, and then everyone in the discord tells you "no that is the best part of the cheese, you should have rushed alt 7"
is the only way to get it to seriously wish for it
ya
or rng it
is there a way to apply the specific wish for arena effect to a spell
instead of wish
ahahahaha
.
g a m e  i s  b a d
i guess arena mod is just... the same as it was in dom4 then
can you put this https://www.dropbox.com/s/klfrh5mdn1ddo4d/arenamod.zip?dl=0 in the mods channel
https://www.dropbox.com/s/klfrh5mdn1ddo4d/arenamod.zip?dl=0 arena mod
i did a very very small amount of work with the water mod yesterday
what about the rockers channel ha ha.
i created the text file, stole several assets and modified one item
good
as an undocumented feature arena mod includes frost fiend sprites and shinu flag differentiation for all ages games
i follow in the spirit of how illwinter does things
is the shinu flag 128x128
which is the new flag size
no i guess i have to edit it
trillwinter
can i just blow it up to 128x128 and resave without it looking really fucking ugly
or do i have to find the new flag sprite somewhere
i did exactly that and i dont care if it's ugly because fuck to shinuyama
lol
#rekt
i also fixed all of the id numbers so it should be good for dom5. i will check if it actually works when i get home i guess
honestly m8 just release it and people will tell you if it's broke
already done
god the original items are so goddamn bad
that fucking heavy ass armor piece just lol
the champ cuirass?
aye it's an abomination
#selectarmor 200
#enc 1
#end
that one and the weapons are the biggest pieces of shit probably
gladius has 1 attack, no ap no aoe or anything. trident is 2 attacks but locks you out of shields
which is why i deleted the trident and just made the gladius have 2 attacks and ap
yeah you should
<@!169456837236621312> when you increase the image size, choose nearest neighbor method
it keeps the sharp pixel edges
what did you change abt the arena
also i wish arena was moddable
i really wanted to make a bi-seasonal arena mod
like every winter and every summer there would be a scheduled arena and i think that would be cool
all of the items are modified to include a 150g monthly purse
and possibly tailored arena gifts, like looking at the winner for magic paths and maybe making a unique booster or something
and all of the bad items were made not bad. the trident is removed and replaced with a shield that gives invuln 10 and mirror image
nice
invuln10 is so meh
if that destroyed my vineshield i'de be pissed
vine shield is not an arena combatant item
but skeletons
i couldn't think of anything that would find both invuln 10 and mirror image useless
but swarm
if you send a mage to the arena they should die on the way and your pg should get 100 horror marks
a skelespammer would appreciate the invuln 10 and the protect from arrow
lol
and everyone likes 150g
early mages to the arena are so easy though
when no one has any construction
yes...
if it's 150g though some people would maybe send their gods
because that's a significant boost
an assured death sentence later, but the gold income is good
sending your god would make it die next arena
yes. but you get 150g a turn
because by next arena people would just have frozen heart or liquify or something
i guess
if it's a particularly swole god he could maybe survive that stuff too
hell, just doing curse and skelespam would kill a pretender
dunno what kind of piece of shit pretenders you are running but the badasses over here can take one skelespammer
the pretender wouldn't get its blesses fyi
i'd be more concerned with anti sc thugs or bottle wizards with some idiot spell to fuck them up
if it's one of the ubiquitous en gods he will self cast regen + epower and not care at all about skeletons
any blood nation could easily make a god assassinator
leech is blood seven though
life for a life is 8
still, the real argument is that it's probably worth it to trade your eventual pretender death for an early boost
specifically if it's a god that is only to expand early, who's bless is not critical to your survival
so when he is called to account and murdered in the arena you aren't fucked for the few turns it takes to call it back
inb4 reincarnate god
are there any good nations that would appreciate a lich sc?
the ud specific blesses don't really work well for theredos i think
or sceleria
sceleria sacreds have teeny tiny hp and no prot so ud regenerate doesn't work well
and the blesses that work well for sceleria sacreds don't work well as a lich sc bless
maybe nazca
<@282646158218756116> what nazca bless do you run
a7w10 awake
a7.. thunder weapons and quickness?
are there any ud sacred nations that would benefiet from ud regen besides lemuria or ma ermor?
benefeit
hmm marybe morrigans but they already have lifesteal
i guess la agartha
is a sepucheral build for la agartha even good?
my only experience with lagartha was mo money, recruiting blindfighters everywhere

i like that my wandering ronin dai oni have 7/10 hero slots in therodos game
please leave me alone
go fite caelum
i'm not fite
i'm on safari
around the world in 30 turns
so assuming that therodos doesn't die horribly to everything in the first year. what big magicks should be researching?
beyond more fart vapors
and swarm
burton of tim
i have to research my flipper mages first for that
you arent dying to anything unless there are other uw
atlantis üòÑ
you are dead
lol
but i have floating mind to survive
i guess i should probably research water elementals to counter his water elementals
maybe jsoh knows what to do
floating mind will die in like 2 turns to atlanteans
his whole gimmick to survive is ethereal
which does not work on atlantis
what you should do is roll over and die
i don't even have body ethereal yet
checkmate atheists
atlantis mentioned failing expansion into merrows, so i'm hoping he doesn't realize his advantage over me
lol
he also took an obelisk, so i'm hoping for a pillar bless situation
.markov
hm
ea atlantis seems to only have one magic weapon troop
well
also living pillars
.tags jsoh
oh nice we have tags
they have deep one spearmen
which is the one you spam all the time anyways because it's 10g for 2 decent attacks and one of them is magic
i could probably earthquake a bunch with my floating mind, but that takes rp
if you can get rp you can take him
if he's halfway decent at the game you will be sieged in your cap year 1 tho
would eq be the thing to rush you think?
or swarm
what paths are on the mind
uhhh... i think w4e5s4n2?
fucked up
alt2 ench2
then alt4
that was the plan
then either conj for elementals or evo for earthquakes
oh wait. i guess i can't cast eq underwater
the mind has been earth melding like crazy against indies and that seems to be really effective
monkee what are likely immediate research goals for lanka? i have a plan but i'm not sure it's the best one
i guess it probably depends on what you're recruiting
any air nation with access to an a3 probably wants tstrikes/stormpower/storm asap
in that order
there are a surprising number of other, lower research things you could go for first instead
but yeah thunder is very good
depends who you're next to and if you went high bless or no
skelespam into abysia would be a mistake but vs like marverni it's prob a good shout
yeah as i see it like, t-strike is an option
skelespam is an option
some kind of nature shenanigans are an option too (web, swarm, sleep cloud)
internet went down bad yesterday. should be back in the game in a few hours.
rushing blood and construction is an option too but one that gets you killed if your neighbors are smart
eventually you will have all this stuff
if you survive, which is cool
seems like a very versatile nation some ways
hmmm
i wonder how a pure blood nation would do
only blood mages, no xpaths
they should get rushed and killed every game
p bad i think but agony could carry them against some factions at least
yeah imps + agony does some work but probably not enough
itd probably depend on the strength of their troop lineup
unless their troop lineup is better than ma abysia they'd do worse than ma abysia
which isn't good
ma abysia has decent troops but not a lot of toolbox
hmmm
interesting: there is no nation with an out-the-box garaunteed demon knight caster. at best, some nations have access to it on a random
or upon forging a blood/earth boosting
booster
berytos generally gets them
ye, on a random
but there is no garaunteed e2b2 in the game
ea pangaea is pretty good too. not guaranteed. but if you recruit two pans, it's essentially guaranteed with earth boots
yes, i understand that
theres a big file full of community approved pretenders im looking at right now, and ea ermor has a demilich with 2a10d
the palest riders
would glamors protect against arrows?
i don't think so
and when an arrow hits the glamourman, the glamour gets popped
<@184675842432040960> stop stalling the turn.

well actually they all fled and then the myrmecoleon went berserk and slaughtered everything
the clans falter under lion's leadersihp, but triumph under ant's leadership.
that was a lot of pd
that was a hail mary and im shocked, now everybody should dogpile hellheim because he's pretty much down to the elf volkssturm after losing all hit shit
i will regenerate my losses at an alarming rate
also yeah. fear bless is a little underwhelming with the changes
from dom4 'insanely good and op' to dom5 'reasonable cap on morale penalty actually'
it's good but not stupi good
educational
antlion.
not pictured in this screenshot-
the 250 units of pd
how much pd was that anyway
"im not owned, im not owned...", ramc croaked as he limped from the battlefield, "i'll send in the ss!"
(i did rout all 250 pd units üòê )
"mein fuhrer..." said the remaining vanherse, "steiner... steiner couldn't mobilize enough men. there's a cap on sacred recruitment."
the kitfox stratagem
kitfoxxed again!
61 pts for 292 guys. apparently it's cheaper because of a "friendly civilization" bonuses since the pd were lion tribe
i'm not crying i have allergies
i'm not spitting blood this is victory wine
lol
owned by racism
he's probably not happy about my armies invading him that are immune to fear and glamour
:crosses arm crossly:
i did a lot of testing trying to combo the awe and fear bless, and kept butting up against how expensive and mediocre the fear component was
i want to love fear, but not at d10
yeah
fear should probably be like d8
now
blood vengeance is b8
"why did you lose to machaka?" "he could afford to set his pd to 61 because in the world of dominions every black guy knows each other"
yikes
hey can i just.. like.. have one guy be the communion master and do nothing but cast buffs, and all the slaves cast the real spells
slaves can't cast
o
anymore
but what you have described was a real strat in dom 3
magma bolts: untyped damage? just "magic" and "crush" so they work vs fire boys and earth boys?
yeah getting hit by a big chunk of magma just crushes you
i think they also have a chance to set you on fire
which fire resistance will help you not take damage from
what happened to maverni?
yeah thats what it reads like
pretty easy to cast spell for what it does imo
who was gonna do the friday blitz
someone promised
there would be a bliztztz
i should summon some lammashtas to see if they are good
it doesn't have any aoe
it's like three very heavy arrows that set you on fire: the spell
it's good!
the magma explode one is way better though
!details

yeah thats a few turns away right now
my big magic artillery is shadow blast
also that battle is against agartha which is all earth eles and magma babies
can someone test if bringer of fortune units stil lwork
ive gotten 0 events since patch
could just be unlucky but okay
which t'ien chis have them
gg
middle
i have luck 3 and many fire birbs
<@110124675580862464> have ur rus results changed since patch at all
very confusing that i feel like i have three viable rush targets as bogarus
boo
why did you all decide to fuck up expansion
i have about 255 masters of rituals and i am never seeing more than 6 events a turn
sometimes i see only 1 or 2
pretty rare that
*tho
i have order 3 and luck 3
got 9 events!
at about 300 dudes
283
then 3 next turn
then 9 again
so i think they are working
11 events at 336
pretty sure you cant rush me
but ok
still can get turns with 5 or less events with nearly 400 of these little bringer of fortune 2 dudes
rare though
i think it's rolling the d100s
maybe it used to use bringer of fortune + luck to roll, and now it doesn't?
probably not
probably just bad luck
ye
ty
anyway i got 15 events at 398 dudes, gonna stop now
all my provs have 100 defense and i have 55k gold in the bank
so there's a death match
are we making any rules for it?
@boing pls let me have 80 in lanights tia
oops
does it still ping if i had to edit it for the ping
lol
probably
jsoh i got 7 events in rus last turn in nazca game
speaking of which, i forgot which troop i decided was best. chud hunters or bear warriors
chud
they're cool
but also they are on team horror.
ok. that was the most fun i have ever had looking at an inventory tracking system
??
the system didn't filter input data
so, i pulled up the configuration barcode on my phone, put the scanner in configuration mode
changed it to barcode 128
and sql injected their system
and told them to fix their piece of shit code
did everyone clap
no
mostly i was trying to make it obvious that we should not buy this
and that programmer... was albert einstein
barcodes are super fun to mess with. if you ever have to work on point of sale or tracking systems and you bother to learn about them
and business applications are usually shitbad so you can break things hilariously with idiot knowledge which is all i have for this kind of stuff
our pos system at my place is p poor
they usually are
like someone at the uni macgyvered something together
velcro is for real involved
the stuff we were looking at is pretty new and expensive
and also very bad
well "new" the interface looked like it was made in 1998 and never updated
very win98se ui feel
helheim did, i believe

üòê
and it just took raw data straight from the scanner and fed it straight in which is super cool
!details

it's turn 9 and i have 3 provinces
!details

rule 1: don't lose
bad harvest in your capitol. eat shit guy with luck scales.
counterpoint: getting 1000 gold, gems and an artifact with luck 3
fair
i meant more along the lines of don't be a jerk like the ai and send prophets who just smite duel for 50 rounds lol
yeah i am always tempted to summon they
are lammashtas sacred?
yeah it is a wilderness of garbage
i dont think so
they aren't your units anyway
right
but
i was thinking maybe it summoned them and then they turned horror team the turn they were summoned
and if your pg was in the battle they could end up blessed
but still hate you
i guess that's insane
they are not sacred in any case
it should be so so so so so easy to tell it to cap input at like 20 char
it didn't even filter for input
it was supposed to accept alphanumeric barcodes
u can generate something like this though, with like 10 seconds of looking up the configuration thing on the internet https://i.imgur.com/d4vqpd9.png
set the scanner in config mode, change the barcode type to a cool one with special characters and then generate an appropriate barcode on the internet
that's neat
do you need to know what kind of hardware / os the thing is running on for that to work? seems like you would.
you need to know what kind of scanner it is to google the config info, and then you could just guess by slamming in inputs
hm
i wonder if you could make a barcode to make self checkouts dispense cash
the blindest of blind injection attacks
false
or just for free groceries
those wouldn't accept negative dollar values would they
free groceries would probably be easier to manage
they have cashback generally
that's done at a separate step though.
true
seems like something that i could spend some time looking into if i wanted to go to jail eventually
more like lacka
as in, lacka turns
i saw a guide on how to reconfigure atms so they read their 100s stack as their 20s stack
obviously if you know what it's hooking into it's a lot easier, but i'd imagine it's not exactly secret knowledge and you could get it with trial and errors
so you could withdraw a hunded in 20s and get 500
relies on them having default factory passwords tho
man
i wonder how many atms have factory default passwords
probably not many
never underestimate the stupidity of man
right after nine eleven, when i was working in govt, sometimes i had to go up to transmission towers on mountains and things
the gate and security codes were the same at all of them, depending on who owned it
and if you googled it, it came up on the internet
wow
i guess the 7-11 down the street from me did have the atm stolen out of it by the same dude driving a pickup truck through the front wall and then pulling it out 4 times before they caught him
and they sure did keep putting the atm back in the same place
partial king retains his crown üëë
in a chain i worked in 90% of the places had the store number as the code to get into the back
yeah thats common
please stop encouraging me to do crime
dominions question: shinuyama? they are bad, but i am curious if anyone can wring some value out of them
it is easy to do a crime the hard part is to not get caught. the more you do it the higher odds of getting caught. its extremely not worth it
they are very bad
i worked at a pharmacy in cambridge that my friend tells me is in gravity's rainbow as a place hobo characters steal cough medicine to chug
i am like 'yeah that checks out'
people are superstitious: gain 30 unrest
also i realize now that i've sorta fucked my scales. whoops.
i thought 'they're bad but there's probably a good way you can play them.' after some practice games i couldn't find it.
make ten thousand bakemono archers and lose anyways
is a good strat
take unaging bless probably
that is the strat lp superstar gabriel pope used against me in corn
but i was pan so
poor fuckin shinu not a single god with n natively unless it's a man or an immoble
i am currently shinu in a game
i am crushin' it
yeah, mass archers and go enchantment for flaming arrows is always a thing you can do
go crazy bless and make a god that can make shrouds to bless you shuten doji is an insane thing you can maybe do
that i want to try out next time i play as them
you have zero native s
so probably not a good plan
you could do bless strat but the only gem useful for that is death
<#
‚ù§
great enchantres
ez
yeah i think it might be worth a try and fail
shinuyama has a lot of things it can do but none of them super well
what would you even put on a shuten doji to make it not die
air shield?
ethereal?
heat aura/cold aura
they don't have invuln
and just pray for an s indie?
so like archers will murder you
quickness maybe
so they can life drain more
but yeah a bless to keep them alive long enough to heat/cold/sleep aura things
maybe stygian skin, or barkskin
brigand lair in my cap, thanks game
shinu would probably be okay in a disciples game
they have 8 base prot
not good, but okay
hmmmm, if we ban pan, asspodel, and nazca
ermor idea: cyclops w death explosion and astral, and all he does all game is forge shrouds and medallions of vengeance
shinuyama kind of maybe needs unaging also
i am doing well with that and scales
the mekone giants being size 4 with formation fighter 1 is almost cool
would be cooler if they had formation fighter 2 though
3 forts churning out sorcs as quick as possible
why don't they have halt sacred
like ulm does
alll of the anime nations are good in disciples
because they have powerful sacred gem sinks
nobody plays disc games
we don't have a way to host them on snek
is why
lets fuken disc blitz right now
uhhhh
i mean i can host a game if it was really wanted
but disciples are poison
disciples blitz sounds like it would unblitz kinda fast
because you have to actually talk to your teammate
it doesnt work as a blitz
enforce a 3 minute turn timer
you can
but also no
not a hard 3 minutes but like in a debate
can corbeau's mapgen make disciple maps with clustered or unclustered starts?
lemme check
i want to play a disciples game
its not an option??
i also gotta take a shit so imma do that real quick
how do you organize a disciples game? have people volunteer to be team leaders and work out the bless? will all the good players form a wrecking squad and leave the rest of us to flop about
yes
probably also draft
you make teams, then you draft nations
then some stupid fucker makes a map and everyone uploads. then u start
with the first pick in the draft i select: middle nazca
and within 2 years half the teams are ai and the game is a rolling garbage fire
next pick in the draft: any other nation with air income
next pick: any other nation with a spell that summons sacred units
nazca jomon mictlan
or shinu rather
just because, you have to pick shinu
hmm
it makes them feel better about themselves
i would prefer more capital air income
but mictlan is for sure
mans income is air and nature right
man fits in there
they have no sacred summons worth a shit
and their sacreds are trash
yeah but
they dont need them to do anything
they dont need the gems os much either
since you just wizard pile
and longbows
if you had that team everyone would take lightning resistance bless
so you'd need someone else to be the god and pick not shock weapons
can you imagine how dumb battles would be if disciple's dudes all joined the same side in one battle instead of there being consecutive battles, so that your scripting could fuck up your allies' scripting
every battle would devolve into the battlefield turning into a poison quagmire
i like the idea of allies accidentally standing in each other's earthquake traps also
i mean either c'tis goes early and everyone loses, or they go late, and just c'tis and their opponent lose
i tihnk man is obviously the pretender in that build monkey
and also you probably eventually want perpetual storm
speaking of which the thing i am most disappointed in myself in in dominions 5 so far is that i did not use a scout to supply my immobile god in nazcagame with earth gems so he could earthquake repeateadly
not satisfied with killing a thousand men already
i could have killed all your idiot wizards with their making skelemans
and then maaaaybe killed the banes and banelords before they chopped me down because less distractions
but
no sense crying over unspent earth gems
i would have sent the thugs in several turns earlier if i wasnt worried about you reinforcing the statue with mystics
i would have sent them in alone, too
i think i could have killed them alone
maybe not, though
jerek did u see the story of my monolith repeatedly spending 10 gems on earth elementals after defeating a single scout
this is the kind of ownage u could have felt
hey everyone big news i found the correct use case for the crown of +undead leadership
its : u have a guy who can sail and need him to bring a bunch  of skelemans to a place
sounds legit
i was gonna guess you give it to a shitty fishman indie commander to lead undead invasions under the sea
skeletons are really bad under the sea
theyl ose t oshit you can't imagine they could possibly lose to
also about being under the sea, is oceania even more op than pan?
lol
dont they just have most of the same shit but amphibious?
no
oceania is decidingly not pan
centaurs minotaurs and satyrs
just with fishtails
yeah
fish tails and laso like
-2 stats
they also dont have seducers
it is literally a worse pan
or maenads
don't they have sirens?
sirens just kill shit
they dont give you diversity
oh hmm
also oceania notably dies to any other water nation
i like that they have people with lobster claws on their heads, but hate everything else
if oceania has the ocean uncontested its the normal 1 water nation bullshit
ugh guys i am crushing it as shinuyama in more turns
turn has turned
who is helheim?
its me!
it has
bone tribe has a caster unit right
i swear they had, like, a super obnoxious unit
they have a wizard
and also all of their dudes are berserkers
boner eaders
surprisingly few units with 'bone' in name
i wish i didn't summon those fire drakes
i kinda like having a few of those little guys around.  not sure i'd make a lot but if they happen to be in the right spot then they can potentially fry a lot of stuff
also javelins
<@282646158218756116> mictlan gets bonus bless points i assume you let him be god
oh yeah that makes sense
berserk+thunder weapons condors
or just regen
condors have like 15 hp dont they
18 wow
this is my ma mictlan god https://i.imgur.com/gcoumhs.png
it would work in disciple too probs
oh is their
bonus astral air? i thought nature air
i just had a battle where all the kills were from them
frying my own mans
i am too used to abysia
2a 1n
i did not use the n just cheap thunder weapons
i would probably adjust a bit for disciples and make two versions depending on other nations
why luck
you dont need luck for twist fate
hmm that god seems fucked up i must have had luck and changed my mind
that would be cool though.
https://i.imgur.com/bjh6vlb.png for no ashdod team
if there's no ashdod team that works fine
wouldnt your entire team get dying dominion
ma mictlan doesn't have dying dominion
ma mictlan is the friendly cuddly one
yeah, that happens too üò¶
the fuck does nazca even want on a disciple
barkskin
?
you dont pick a bless on disciple
just a chjassis
oh sorry i mistook nazca for abyssia,  and disciple for pretender and want, for really want
heavenly condor?
can get air 8 +2 in anything else
can certainly expand with that bless also
https://puu.sh/zavfy/0be722748c.jpg
ya that looks fine
you get 1d6 condor friends with luck quick thunder blood surge so he could expand regardless probably
if there was some fucker bless team on the other side with like ashdod + jotuns + agartha or w/e it would have to be modified
cause they could do quickness fire&shok res and we'd be fucked
i mean
you just take unholy weapons right
the fucking real low mr on condors and jaguars is painful
yeah. probably air shield quickness unholy and twist fate or luck depending
alternatively fear+air shield+ quickness
you'd need offense on there though
actually maybe try to shove in berserker somehow with unholy if you went that way
so eagles and condors can hurt normal stuff
actually instead of unholy
stack strength
ap damage vs statues tho
3 sources of +2 strength
nazcar can strength of giant and rage of the rat
condors with 23 strength are probably fine with no ap
also they are very angry and never run away
whats the paths on rat rage
thau4 n2
oh
that ez then
i thought itwas more than this
https://i.imgur.com/zzjkymo.png to deal with team lame as fuck giants?
how much berserk is rat rage
+1 i think
giant is 4 right
yes
so 23 strength condors hitting 4 x a turn with 18 attack
how many does a8 summon per turn
oh and with that i can send all of mictlans pearls plus her pearls for huaca
which when mixed with condor will provide a scattering of awe
noice
i can't actually think of a good counter to those sacreds
18 magic attacks at 23 strength x 4 built in arrow fend with berserk
22
there is no scenario in which you do not get horribly fucked up to win
i dont think you need another air nation as 3rd person
you have 2a to start, can alch s and both mictlan + nazca can prioritize a2 search
you will very easily sustain 9a
having berserk on all of your mages tho
yikes
born to die world is a fuck
at least mallqui are immune to berserk
and turket is not sacred
maybe marignon is the master
mari suffers terribly with those scales
yeah but they get zordon and 2 discounts
and honestly only need production 1 for maximum paladin
can friendly masons upgrade forts
i guess u just give them the province then take it back
mictlan doesn't care
city palisade own

real dedication
to give you diarrhea. wow therea some gamers among the enemies
sounds like we can expect a lot more posts from <@96715337440952320> ha ha ha ha !!
whats a good item for nazca to forge to use to punch a monolith to death
dusk dagger maybe
2 smashers
that also ya
pro strat to kill monolith from surrounded game: simply have the battle bug out somehow and keep some of your routed forces on the map long enough that the monolith dies alongside them in the cleanup phase
i think i almost got that
from my dudes being hella paraylzed
if i had the berserk bless ive been workshopping as a replacement for blood surge i would have
i glanced at the battle report and thought it looked really bad for me beacuse i lost like 30!!!!! dudes
and then i looked again and every single tihng on the enemy side that wasnt a monolith died
this i think might have been due to a turn-specific thing where they were earth melded by the monolith on the turn they were supposed to run
13 mages
for 22 condors and 7 condor warriors 7 supayas
adn another 4 of something or other that didnt retreat good
seems fairly worth
sucks tho its getting close to horror fun times and i just lost 2 attacks on thrones
what does sphinx/dust walker throne cast
i feel slightly "done" that the enemy apparently got their monolith inside the fort when it finally woke up
this guy teleported his hes been awake a long time
nice larger/unaging bless ftw eriu not entirely sure what that was about but good job
enlarged golem dominion monolith
is not something condors can kill in 50 rounds
have you considered simply casting weapons of sharpness
dont have the reasarch
also its etheral
huh
shock fatigue damage is not just stun
its also just adding fatigue
ya
the stun is as a secondary effect to the shock/shock-fatigue damage
huh
might have killed him if it was condors in front instead of supayas mostly
but they would ahve been more often paralyzed due to shit mr i guess
shit mr and also their weapons aren't innately magic unlike supaya spear
more supayas would probably have done t
started at 340~ hp and they chipped it down to 104
102!
gave him a chest wound at least . it says it will give 5 spellcasting encumbrance but that doesnt make any fucking senses
some bugs limped cryle's hauca lol
1 an damage super strong
t i n y b i t e
love that the uw version is the completely useless version of tiny bite
which is 1 damage capped at 1 but not 1an
lol
fuck the ocean
love 2 have a 58% chance to do 1 damage to something with 0 prot
why would you cast swarm instead of casting water elmentals
i totally shithoused this throne in therodos game
sailed in my skeleton crown telkhine friend
leading 2 casts owrth of hidden in snow goons
and like half a dozen sea dorfs to cast dragons teeth
and the guy i was fighting staled that turn so it was just vs pd
lol
jsoh of course anyone w/ a clue and ability to read the mod inspector would not cast swarm uw but for those who do not, lol
ys went ai?
<@!205774730244915202> whats up dude
j bereton do you want to sub, for lord sloth
its 15 turns until cataclysm
the entire world has gone to shit
i do not really no
<@282646158218756116> ? i have no shame turn
true
not anymore you fuck
you just let it sit for the full timer
you ahve to submit when you die . you died in warcrimes
and everyone waited .
the true pro revenge strat
brainwrinkle don't tell me i got no turn, i don't do no turn
are ethereal units immune to earthquake?
or uhh, resistant
ya
they roll vs earthquake the same way they roll vs any punch
also it's resisted by defence
is nifflehams actually good
it seems kind of shitty
like none of these changes really help nifflehams.
niefelheim i think might be a shit nation
doesn't help that their pg selection got gutted on the release version
so they can't get 2 free f gems/turn
that pg is actually so expensive im not sure its even worth it
it's 240 which i think for a blood + astral nation is prob worth it
niefel doggo is definitely a better raw fighting pretender tho
!details

if lanka stalls im postponing all wars to fuck w him

they could at least get some water bless bonus or something so they could take a cheap quickness doggo and rush celestial rainbow

ah
that's a lot of area that's about to be ai chaff

god damn fucking flaming arrows failing to go off

yay turmoil bro didn't sall :toot:
i've just recruited a mage named ma wang
[in extremely zonk's own zonkmod voice] also i haven't tested this extensively, so i'm sure there are bugs. specifically, i didn't check if ys recruitment works properly inland.
ya it does sound like a burden to load up silent seas and go 1 prov off the coast ü§î
wheres my demon general undead leadership jbrere
üò†
it cannot be added to a game in progress but is in the current version to download
also how are you doing in the yomi mod game
eh meh
not had a proper fight against anyone yet
the starting onis in cap made expansion a lot easier tho
what do you mean
about demon general
the demon general prophetshape lacked #goodundeadleader because i accidentally deleted the tag while cleaning up some nonfunctional magic stuff
.markov demon
have you used the yomotsu spell conot
and if so how have you found it
don't think so, which one is that
the swamp castable namanari transform
<@282646158218756116> demon general loses like, 50 undead leadership as a result, which amused me sharply considering the prophetshape is described as "a very good commander"
oh!
i did actually, during a test run
it's nice to have greater path variety
not used it in anger yet
lol
none of rus pd has a ranged weapon
not a single one
fuck you game
after the solar weapons trebled prot debacle i am slightly worried that demon cleansing is going to double demon prot in a hame i am in lol
<@96715337440952320> i always have difficulty deciding whether namanari transforms are worth the gems on anything other then giving them more paths for site searching
what does rus do against 16 demons of heavenly fire
it's a big research boost conot
and 6 heavenly doggo
yeah
how good are your bears r/n jsoh
they have quickness and luck bless
but you need death gems for summons n shite too
im certain i die
do you have the swarm or lightning damage spells
yes
they fly
and have quickness
b/c if so i think you own them quite hard although luck is going to be a minor prob
i believe my mages might be died
very fastlike
put them in the middle of your pd shamecube imo
he also is apparently prepared to cast "make water elemental"
probably one of the top 20 more useful spells in the game!
is orb lightning good
it seems very good
id ont know if this guys going to attack my capital or the fort next ot it h,,
hmm
orb lightning is quite dangerous
yeah
im extremely unsatisfied with this game and want to explode myself
because im going to die to ai
in that case arm everyone with thunder whips and cast orb lightning a lot
because i havent gotten any fucking events in like a year almost
and the ai sent its unstoppable army of "guy who gets gold so he can have troops" to take my province that has 4 fire gems a turn
... are you dying to ai agartha?
yes.
well not dying
but i lost an unbelievable amount of things to them
ive killed their god again lol
i'm ashamed for you
same.
i had enough gems to make him go ai
but not enough gems to kill his stack of like 10 oracles
see kids: this is why you don't go ai
i killed his god
again
by having some trolls
you can always be a clever stubborn bastard, instead of letting the ai do it
because i was trying to make a death mage so i ahd to make a forest troll
forest trolls do pretty well at killing earth elementals + idiot gods
gods are suprisingly fragile
i learnt back in the dom4 disciple game that a stack of 30 tuatha warriors can kill pretty much any combatant god
i think i'd racked up three dragon kills and a gorgon by the the time it finished?
everyone other than me is much stronger than me because they have the capacity to make troops
therodos took my silver mine :(
lordsloth reporting for therodos game. one day internet crapped out on me, next day i collapsed asleep. this morning, i couldn't complete my turn in the thirty or so minutes i was drinking coffee. i should be back on track, aside from being invaded
ok!
yea, go and talk to abyisa and cealum about that
wow thats a lot of mages
https://puu.sh/zahi4/8e1217cc10.jpg unfrozen warriors confirmed for good
hmm spartae dont have descriptions
kill six billion elves
are spartae supposed to not be undead beacuse thats fucking silllly
yes
they're statues iirc
ok yeah it says on the tin they look like skelemans but are not
do they not have descriptions because this game started wbefore the exist
or is it just :illwinter:
no they don't have descriptions because illwinter are lazy bastards
who didn't even give them to mekone like they said they were going to
this is a very very strong spell
i think i probably, probably, didnt need to cast it 15 times in that battle
but it certainly helped
that battle was won with rigor mortis+farts holding all the birb wizards in place until they died of poison
shit that was real fucking close, i very nearly accidentally put the guy holding illwinter into the death match
high stakes
im much better at playing death/nature nations than playing fuckin rus or mictlan i think
if you hold a global in the arena you should get +2 att/def imo
just to encourage some ballsy plays
nah
a hard coded unique effect for each
lol
eyes of god +10 prec
what every powerful astral mage dreams of, more precision
cold power 3 for illwinter
joke is that the arena is neutral
that would be very good
yeah
the arena should be cold if iw is up def
and hot if second sun, and dark if dark
yep
i like that it is sometimes randomly in 2 magic spook zone
except the arena is well known to be run by interdimensional horrors
its fucking goofy how much better at leading demons/undead melia are than any thing yomi gets really
like yomi would kill for melia
my best move so far has been blanketing the abyssia/maverni border in scouts. this is real melodrama! we're onto our fourth huge turnaround.
that feel when meliai are described with water being not their natural home but they are uw recruits for therodos
yeah
they live under water because the kingdom was destroyed
but they dont like it
cant see in the dark
they are also coastal
im soon to have enough pearls to make a ring i think
so i can finally cast the boat
except that i got mages from hidden underneath that dont need a ring
and also my rp is really good so i have to chose between the boat or a telkhine
seems like a pretty clear choice
comedy boat
yeah
theres so much coast that i dont hold
and i have like 10 w a turn so i can do both really
sadly in ea tc game i hold roughly 70% of the coast in the game so boat would not be too great
i feel like if i cast the boat tho
its going to run into some huge army from someone overreacting to my ghost raids
cast foul air as well as boat then
to punish them for this
lol
i need a telkhine to cast foul air...
man if people dont start shaping up i might literally win this game as therodos and thus have to strike them from the list of bad nations
b/c if  i can win 2 games in a row as a nation they cant be bad
even tho this game is insanely dumb
oh wow actually
this hero telkhine almost has fuckin rainbow paths
need to empower once to cast rainbow actually
or empower like 5 times in blood and i have no blood
<@96715337440952320> do you know what spells sphinx throne casts
no idea i'm afraid
what paths do they have
rip
probably will of the fates or some shit
sphinx have s/d by default
that seems not likely considering its shades
let's put it this way: do you think it's more likely they will cast antimagic / rigor mortis with illwinter coding them
hmm
im sending a bunch of royal mallqui to insanely brutally banish the shades with aoe 12 banishes
and also a pile of mans to slay
they also have dust walkers which is midly irritating
i hope they cast solar brilliance and insanely brutally fucking destroy my 300 skelemans
and laso pop my royal mallqui
lol
banish has friendly fire right
ya
i dont think boing got pinged after all
hey <@!148098869782118401> let me have 80 in lanights
pretty brave to make demands as a nation with one troop
absum who are you in la nights
support the troop.
do not cave to bogarus imo
isn't having one troop during la the standard
no
i'm so close to going ai in lanights, it's been going real poorly
would anyone be interested in writing up their pretender design /strats etc? id be interested to know what you guys did and what youd improve etc
i cant handle misfortune
i dont know hwow to get rid of horror cults
yeah sure. 1) i'm bad. 2) blood bond + regen + tree

seems like my best move would be to siege your cap forever and protect the precious bot caster
i wish your god had still been alive, that probably would've made it a lot more climatic
but it turns out an unbreakable front line with flame weapons and 20+ priests are pretty good vs. undead
sounds legit
bot vassal state
you can all be safe and sound, nestled behind my slave shields
:through forced smile as visibly aging: i... love agartha
also the fact that you were at war with two other nations was p. good for me too :x
ma agartha  
dom10 o0p1h3d3l3m3  
asleep monolith with e6s4n4, bless reconstruction, larger, minor & major magic resist, resilient  
didn't put a lot of thought into pretender design and that hurt me quite badly.  dom10 with larger was quite a stretch to reach but did interesting things for agartha's inanimates.  i might consider dom8 or 9 + larger later, relying on temples to hit the higher dominion.  expanded slowly & steadily with stock standard agarthian infantry and stone hurlers.  made a critical mistake in reaching long naps with all of my neighbours, leaving me 0 room to expand afterwards.  
definitely be more aggressive & less prone to long naps in the future.  picked a fight with jotumheim on more or less a whim, which lead to my demise.  did not have enough scouts out and didn't realise that jotumheim had captured someone else's cap and was able to out gem me, as well as not fully appreciating the implications of his blood bond + regen bless.  made extensive use of staff of combustion for my commanders.  in hindsight i should have had some but fewer staves and a lot more summons out.  
managed to hang in there for quite a while and even get my cap back a few times off of the back of stone hurlers on the castle walls & the fat monolith.  next time i won't pass up an opportunity (via hero) to upgrade the cap fort and also be aggressively teleporting the monolith.  eventually brought down by massed magic dual againt my astral magic monolith
tactics i used: nap n-1 neighbours, gang up vs nth neighbour, repeat.
a good plan
get warred by a weaker neighbour
how long had you held that other capital? i thought it was stupid but touch and go midway through and then those nature gems turned into nightmares
since pretty early, can't remember exactly.
asph was my first war for sure
damn.  i really should've had more information before jumping
it was the s4 that really got you though, in hindsight i should have just sat on your cap for years and i'd had had to without it
monoliths are fucking tough
still not sure if lad almost certainly causing afflictions on units who can cast it due to fatigue is a good or bad change
yeah sitting on the cap would've probably been a good move.  monolight can be dualed out as we found but it was a lot of effort to crack agartha's cap, with the darkness, stone hurlers and need not eat
maybe a few thugs with flying and weapons of sharpness would have done it
i am literally being accused of stalling a game where i have taken 4 turns in the past day.
pretty sure it killed  upwards of 200 garms by itself though
i fucking hate these people
would've been interesting.  failing that some battlefield spells
it was a lot

a thing: monoliths get chest wounds.
where do you think they store their misc items?

jesus christ is there no fucking way to fight burning ones without a million points of fr
not in melee, no
battlemagic or crossbows are the only wsy to go
looks like all my bladewinds hit the burning ones
and all my gifts hit the salamanders
weird coincidence!!!
salamanders have more hp /square than burning ones iirc?
which is probably why your gifts go there
does that mean anything
why doesnt blade wind go there
mages usually target most hp, but for projectiles will go for largest mass
is the burning one blob bigger than the salamanders?

also i hate how my mages form communions once they go off script, i had them loaded up with gems to cast on their own.
good game folks!
set myself to ai

"ah thanks, time to make 4 water elementals at great cost vs an army that's completely fucking doomed"
but yea: the larger spread of burning ones will make the ai pick it for blade winds, while the higher hp density means it'll sends gifts there: the exact opposite to what you want
jerek is basially dead ad he's doing 36 hour turns in nazca, i guess that makes him a winner

<@96715337440952320> conservative gem always
ya see this is the kind of mistake i would not have made without being sick üò¶
luckily it is not irreperable
no you are doomed forever sorry
these shoes seem really inconvenient tbh
like they absolutely own and if i win ea tc game it is mainly due to these balanced ass shoes but on a practical level, no good
i rarely have a solo thug who doesn't already have good movement
ok but imagine conot
if they had 35 map move instead of 17 or w/e
the shoes suck
boots of messenger are where it's att
boots of the messenger are a joke by comparison tbh
5 gem cost, reinvig, map move
for most purposes it is superior
the boots of seven mile strides = fliers go roughly infinity provs in 1 turn
i will maybe be making the boots of sanic for my arch devils
but for general use messenger is superior
but imagine jbrere
having teleport and blink
ok...
and so having functional infinite map move
remember quickness boot is map move 12
and also gives a buff that is very strong
true but for high quality mages you just want to be somewhere else, i think the map move boots are probably better
also someone talked about putting up a new game recently
and there is no new game
i have been rused
you can go through like 2 water provs and 2 land ones very easy with 35 map move
it is quite strong
new mod idea: boots of the explorer, automatically site searches any province a mage moves into, astral 4, 15 gems
anyone wanna <#384842667328274435>
debate my non-understanding of dominions game balance
i would enjoy more qol improvements to site searching
site searching barely takes any time i don't mind it too much
and if you absolutely do not want to micro the auto targeting monthly cast thing removes the micro entirely
i want voice of tiamat but for land
acashic record
isnt that like 25 pearls
more like ass cashic record lmbo
yes
do you know how many rabbit foot charms i could equip onto assassins for 25 pearls
its 5. 5 assassins!
i want a global that searches for sites in random provs inside your dominion
uh
is that a joke post
eyes of god does that right
no
it does not
cmon
it reveals every discovered site in the world though
oh neat
uhh presumably it would also reveal undiscovered level 0 sites
@conot has an amazing setup in the mountains in 2001. very lucky. i think its like 7 gems
is there already a global that does what i said
help
it is called strands of arcane power
wtffffffffffffff
which mountain
you mean the throne or
i think i read that once and got it confused for a gem giving global
strands is a legitimately powerful defensive spell if you have very high s
infiltrate should reveal research levels
jotun jarl: why his good luck so good? https://i.imgur.com/rupriq8.png
i wonder if illwinter will ever make battlefield manipulating spells
like spells that create walls and stuff
maybe the big thing in dominions 6 will be cluttered battlefields
i'd only be okay with it if death got one called "the shadow realm"
so i could say "its time to d-d-d-duel!"
earthquake repurposed to just fuck up your formations
would be cool if swamps had like, shitty swamp puddles in the battlefield and stuff or something like that
or forests had a ton of trees that would block projectiles
and fuck up formations
im assassinating all if neifs giants, and i cant kill them, but after 5 rounds they just run off because its better to die than deal with bullshit pseudo ethereal
multi tile monsters please
and better modding support
yes
also a new command called 'repeat script' or loop script or something
accept chaos
ya fuck to more scripting
5 is enough
being able to maybe affect the ais spell casting preference, slightly, while offscript would be nice
so you could make astral less retarded in assassination for example
shout out to the astral starspawn casting mind burn on a mindless void monster
or the badass who spends his last 6 seconds of life making himself ethereal vs a horror
!details

clearly it isslaan
i think astral in general prob needs some more good spells
give me a nation with wild mages who cast spells above their path level but have a chance of horrendous/weird/great side effects
really give me more magocracies in general
blacklisting spells for offscript would be nice
like atleast 1 spell
stuff like blink
or winters breath
no those are good
i fucking hate winters breath for making me worry about mages that have random water paths
stop trying to take away the stupid shit aspect
on a nation that doesn't have cold resist
whats worse is if i put all the random w shitters in a corner by themselves they can sometimes cast winters breath out of order and chill themselves like idiots
i hate it
like i'm ok with blink for the most part but winters breath just makes positioning annoying
also does cold resist help vs cold climates as reptillians?
i read that it does somewhere
!turns
it doesn't
marshmasters still take 10 fatigue in cold 3
they just don't take an extra +2
so it does help
i want to put up a game at some point with the mod that reveals all sites automatically
im in a game right now where the mapmaker put an icon on some tiles denoting them as good shit zones
which, while a cool idea, didn't seem to matter much since that is basically what thrones exist ot be
boing why are you ignoring me
he might be invading you
i'm invading you
fortune teller [100] would just negate all bad events forever, right?
in that province, yea
and also tell you about every event that has a delayed onset
i had the city of the damned in my cap ring
i think i should have built a lab there or something and moved some augurs
<@!169456837236621312>  if there is a global slot and multiple people try to cast globals into it, is there a priority system and can they knock other ones that are already up off other spots?
it'll happen by ritual casting order
(which is pretty much random: in province number order but random top->bottom bottom->top order
!details
once you try to cast onto a full list, it picks a random global and tries to overwrite: not sure of total gems or only overcast gems count for this check

this game turns v fast.
ok so if two people are casting a global into a list with one slot missing, the first goes through and then the second has a chance to overwrite?
it does like clash between them?
doesn't*
sounds like you should cast destruction.
nope
the  first goes through fine. the second will hit a random global(i think, it might be last slot but i think it's random) and try to overwrite than
<@!148098869782118401>
just invade him, absum. the jsoh hello.
i just want to know if i can have the indie province
you can give the province back...
absum send your turn into la nights
so you can have another turn to do
it'll be good i promise
take it and ask forgiveness
possession is nine tenths of the will of heaven
im asking because he will probably move his pretender to take it this turn
and if i have to take a different province i'm going to end up being a 1 province snake
again
that was a nice attack man
what
you cant have any province
go away
i havent looked at the map.
its the one south of your pretender
with the heavy cav
no i want it.
are you moving your god there
this turn
he won't respect you without the jsoh hello. hit him.
who was abysia again

hi
<@96715337440952320> nothingtoseehere described exactly how it works
ty
i am utgard the mightee
unless you have a laser dog and a renamed prophet there cannot be peace between us
who are you even talking to monkey
you
i dont border you??
its the thought that counts
if you kill boing you will border me
or jonjoe
laser dog is too hard to kill
i might kill jonjoe it depends on whether he recovers and has lots of annoying bow shit
boing if you dont take the province with your god this turn and i changed my orders for nothing that will be a declaration of war imo
lmao what can u do about it with your babby army
babby russian girly men cannot harm laser dog
run circles around it obv
i am a master of running in circles
im looking here in the manual and there is not a running in circles battle win condition
no wait i know i can make the old h3 men and they will petrify it
lol
running in circles win condition is a turn 100 clean up
utterly devastating both sides
well boing is gone again i think so ill just submit
ok looks like im at war now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7g6_n7aw8g <- theme tune of this game i think
if you by some miracle kill his dog send me a screenshot and i will dutifully hitler retard betray
looks like he was gonna attack me anyway??
there are tomb chariots and xbows on my border for no reason
oh wow
fucking gg la nights
patalan luck capital absolutely sieged by dark vines
lmao
screenshot and post in suggestions under the caption "luck sucks make it not suck tia"
nice
is it possible to you unsiege it
there's no commanders
lol
there are 4 commanders
dark vines are commanders
in that event
oh
that incredibly lame as fuck event
my god
commanders thag cannot rout
correct
you have to kill all four
you
got
500 hp of fuck you

i think that event chain is also not over yet

so who knows what brutal ownage i am about to recieve after maybe cleaning it up
i have misfortune three
https://i.imgur.com/qa4kdno.png
<@178868273935417344> my army is there to take the province you dingus
they arent next to the province
can i have your stuff jbrereton
658g for misfortune 3, dark vines for everyone else
oh thats a different army
on account of you are dead forever
lol
.tag absum dingus
dark vine just resist pierce and blunt dont they
omg that is brutal
by my calculations, vanara chakram throwers are perfectly suited for destroying them
didnt ragha attack you also jbrereton
lmao
jesus
i attacked ragha first so that's on me
waht
absum someone has to take on the quadbless heat ragha menace
absum it is an advanced strategem you wouldn't understand
and who better than utterly owned scales patala
paper rushes scissors
monkee get this
not only did 2 of the vines get within >10 hp, the indies also theoretically routed but actually didn't
because mindless
noice
ya
time for a bunch of nagini to get trashed üëç
do you really have luck3
who is agartha and why is your expansion so bad
pay me tribute or i will kill you
its the libs
wait is agartha that new guy who didn't know what was happening
i don't see it registered
agartha is libluini
!status lanights
i have luck 2 boing
whatever fuck you robot
the guy who doesnt know whats happening is caelum
quealed out on them bars
!details lanights

alternatively: the guy who doesnt know whats happening is pythium
my robot is superior.
oh then it's ok if i immediately attack libluini
it would not be uncharitable i think to describe libulini as also not knowing whats happening
lol
gatherer of the dead
so no blindfighter memebless
???? death weapon blind fighters
only the might of blindfighter memebless could withstand giant memebless
the most powerful and often taken death bless
i see death 3 over by him but i assumed that was a site
did... did he take death three
without a bless
i must free the agarthan people from this tyranny
<@!205774730244915202> are you taking 105 this turn in lanights
say no because i would love to have lake acces
poison weapons
poison weapons+ fear
jsoh will you leave me alone
i am friendly russian horse
you have tragically taken a province that is within 16 move of my capital
so i must destroy you
jsoh is a powerful and capricious god. appease him for face his wrath
thats boings fault
he doesn't care
he bullied me with his dog
all he wants is anyplace that moves one province to his cap
i demand province 69 as well
since u have affronted me
i just remembered to check prov names and noticed im about to expand into another person's cap circle
did no one clear their cap circle except boing
i did clear my cap circle
lol
because this is very obviously something to do
my cap circle is clear
your cap circle then cleared you
my province count is honestly quite solid but sadly my 1 fort is under siege by unrouting dark vines which is pretty bad times
absum are you interested in negotiating
pretty fucked up jomon started on a coast
on the plus side it cancelled my recruitment so i have not quite enough to start a second
negotiating how
are you gonna pay me lots of dosh
no. ill let you walk your expensive horsies away out of my provinces
and you can use them to fight someone whos not me
<@!160127200803160064> in exchange for peace leave 163 clear tia
that part of the gay ocean is mine
monkey
conot is the guy whos first expansion
on t2
or 3
w/e
immediately got killed by event
https://puu.sh/zb230/a64fdd6b64.jpg
absum so what you are telling me is i should rush jomon
and agartha
at the same time
<@!160127200803160064> also you have to pay 200g in tribute
jsoh thats not negotiating
are you going to leave or do i have to evict you
these are not even wealthy provinces
don't doubt him btw he can swarm by now
oh he even posted alt4 lol
why the fuck am i getting bullied by two people
you are bogarus
you just went the wrong way dude. its ok
don't be a coward absum
fight them to the death
immediately
well, it would result in immediate death
that part is assured
a linormr beats some bugs be brave
<@!169456837236621312> what game
lanights
i am dub awake incarnate bless utgard and you are tiny anime men
i will insanely brutally cast shrink on your god if u face me
i am two provinces away, about toe xpand into your cap circle with some insanely unstoppable giants
i mean i'm basically already dead in lanights lmao
rip. you even started next to coast.
so "give me 200 gold and let me take land in your cap circle" is basically "oh cool i'll go ai""
hm jsoh are you serious about wanting 69
the prov i want is the water not next to your cap
i would like a buffer yes
69 is also not wealthy
jsoh
not your cap circle. the bribe was to not invade and leave your cap circle alone
siltyomimodgame comes at u fast
thats as far from my cap as from yours
yes
and im stronger than you
ok
i will grant you and honorable death
fight me
and the traditions of anime will live on with the sweaty giants of utgard
eh, at this point you might as well kill me, it saves me the dishonor of going ai
i will dispatch the finest giants, gilded in armor of gold
like i like the idea of jomon being good
but la is just a drag tbh
i even fucked around with several pg builds pre-lanights for them
and none of them really solved the fundamental issue
i actually propheted a guy to get the gold skin https://i.imgur.com/vpycqds.png
jomon is bad
jomon is bad because they are a ma nation
are you researching straight evocation 9 for the rainbow monkey
no i am researching alteration four
the rainbow, and niffle flames
and construction four
i will have unimaginably powerful skratti
and scouts
and those jarl guys
construction four has a dual purpose. if i over extend and am being killed i can immediately make bvc
fuck.  still kicking myself for mistaking riches from beneath for earth blood deep well and casting the wrong global.
lol
so how does pythium kill a linnormrmr
do i make it fistfight a hydra
nothing can possibly go wrong from fistfighting a hydra.
you make bugs at it
oh it has breath and cloud doesn't it
and tail swipe
i don't think you do. but if it comes in your dom just spammed garbage will do fine
can't grow new heads if you don't cut them *head tap meme*
could somebody who is in with the devs tell them that riches from beneath is literally useless in this age of unit recruitment points.
please?
recpoints from beneath
i could cast the incredibly powerful pythium only poison resist on my bugs
you could make some pink guys and probably just spam paralyze at it
with gladiators
with your pythium poison resist spell
paralyze is more than 1 turn out of the way
whgat if someone beats me to moak
super fucked up
well i have researched nothing at all besides alt
and have alt1
lol that patala hired literally all the mercs
unless his second fort finished he now has no income so we can buy them back!
it is extremely legit to hire every merc
i am both alchemising and distilling gold r/n monkee
jsoh please be aware that im insane
an insane anime poster... well i'll be
its cool to say that but more cool that i dont have to say that about myself i think
because someone else will say it for me
59-69-80 will be mine and then we can have a nap
<@178868273935417344> yes. i should have gotten last turn in too
jbrereton if you send every single merc at your cap you should be able to free yourself from dark vine tyranny
luckily, you already have all the mercs
internet problem recovered
correct
yeah jsoh you can have 80
go take 80
if you promise me to take 80
you must fight over 69
i will let you have the other two
is there something special about 80
like a hidden titan or something
its ctis
oh
haha
well next utrn it is
laser dog is bullying you from the same side that im bullying you?? messed up i figured he was the other way
yea i was gonna take that and then he bullied me
get this, he's being bullied from all sides
well
bugs are not scared of laser dog
and gladiators hit fucking hard and have high morale too
yeah trash swam strats can beat the dog
whats his bless
also <@!205774730244915202> what do you mean last turn
e6d2 or something weird
hard skin i think is what i saw
hmm hard skin is kind of a problem
thats what 26 prot
wait jsoh you can see 80 your next to it
yes
i can see
and it has 15 poison resist so it wont die to bug bites
that 80 has crossbows and heavy cav in it
bug bites are not poison
some are an
some are poison
bug bites are mainly 58% one damage always
if you spam swarm hard enough it will work
ya
69 and 80 provide abuffer to my research farming provinces that allow me to feel safe even with hordes of evil russian devil worshippers next ot me
absum if you get your two bullies to fight you win at diplomacy
man i am really glad i won a dom4 games as memebless blindfighters
yea if you are actually taking 80 i will retreat
im not attacking it right now
ramc and i made a pact to exterminate all the blood nations and carried through on it
it was very good
but i want it.
you could probably take it from ctis, but not from bogarus if his candles are there'
its showing only misfortune 2
no candles
and lets be real i can take it from either becuase they are not going to leave their god sitting there
and then i can leave a trap for whatever i see coming
lazer dog and linnormr dont move too strong
do you promise you will take it if ctis takes it first
i will try
good enough lol
im retreating
ok. i will give you 1 turn to evacuate 69
nice
tbh as long as either of you concedes my spite organ will be statisfied
uh
theres snow in 59
my horses cant move past 69 this turn
yeah
you go to 69 this turn, pick up your crossbows, leave next turn
ok ty
i dont think im gonna win the game with two probably succesful bless rushers and a epic rp pythium bully
please remember that i killed my prophet and 2 wizards by scripting badly
.tag jsoh epic rp pythium bully
also the fucking spring bird throne
pythium will be killed later
i refuse to be killed!
it'll happen
always does
lol
idk about ctis. depends how boing's income is looking
he seems to be expanding solidly tho
and idk where ragha is
ragha is 64
boing probably has 4 farmlands
fucked up that everyone has rich farmlands except me
ragha is either cold ragha or has incredibly weak dominion
also me monkee
ragha is hot ragha
jbrereton u dont even have a cap okay
and has literally quad bless
lmao
what are the 4
luck / bsrg / quick / regen
<@178868273935417344> i think i only stalled once due to isp is what i mean
blood surge doesnt count
so i think probably dominion 3
so he has like two birb per turn
this guy is playing in 2006
also, he loses the game if you cast swarm at him one time
uh lord sloth i didnt even know you stalled
because birbs hit their kill limit and shut down
but you are taking 105?
well , ragha can make lots of temples so you dont have to worry about low start domhahahahahhahaah
i dont want to run my snake into hot men
lord sloth bully him
yeah ragha sounds like he's gonna fucking die
hes susceptable
he lost a 164 gold province to me for 2 turns
which is frankly shameful
tfw you take a serious hit by scales patala
as ragha
with four blesses
is ragha really hot
how many scouts will it take to kill 1 point of ragha pd
hot 3 probably
yes absum
i can see t3 prod2 d1 misf3 d3
zheyadan with the hot shah as prophet
is ragha that hot/cold nation?
i have double incarnate giants but i get to make five per turn
yes
yes
zhayedans are good
t3mis3
hell
yes
boing
can we diplomance over the fate of province 80
you mean my province
quick luck surge regen rgahas are the best
he definitely does not die to swarm monkee although i am researching it
<@178868273935417344> and why are you asking me about the turn in lanights? i'm a bit confused since the turn just flipped
boing how do you think your laser dog fares against 160 armor negating 1 damage tiny bites that are size 6
he should die to swarm. you just have to cast it a bunch
reason why: 65 hp regenning gryphon
and have real troops behind the swarms
err size 1
to crit them a lot of times after they have 100 fatigue
lord sloth i am asking if you are taking province 105
nothing else
god damn, ragha and aybsian flags look too close
i dont know about any stales
zhayden die to hypnotize
<@178868273935417344> i've made it to my pc over the last ten minutes so i'll have an answer soon
in theory they do
okej
however, zhayedan have ten thousand combat speed and a naga does not
so you have to survive a round of quickened zhayedan to hypnotize them
nagini don't even have weapons
give your naga commmander a rat tail and a cotierie of bugs to stand next to them
literally using their hand lmao
hand/bite poison spit ftw
i think i could absolutely fucking wreck ragha tho
once i have alt4
<@178868273935417344> it depends. since i've got 3 recruit points. on assassin luck.
swarm bugs with very mad very fast high damage giants behind them
i think if ragha plays badly i can inconvenience them to the point they lose later
which is my pro strat
not heading there with an army if you want to compete for the province
it is the scales patala way
how come ur dudes iron cudgel looks like a spear
oh well then i am sending my snake into it this turn <@!205774730244915202>
i thought somebody said you have a linnomr
he will survive a single black candle
thats not a snake!!!!!!!!
ive been bamboozled
yeah you guys made that up lmao
probably just an ormr
hmm
im pretty sure swarm beats ormr
no
it regenerates a lot
yeah
beats as in "we just wait"
i guess if he casts breath of winter he can freeze some bugs to death
whoever is closer to the middle of the battlefield on turn 50 wins
team garbage wins by fiat
jsoh please focus you are fighting the lizard people
i'm not a huge fan of abysia being next to ragha. i have to look twice to figure out which provinces are mine
nobody said anything about lizard people im fighting a laser dog
sloth, simply wipe them out imo
jsoh asked for 80 and boing said no
80 is currently held be indies anyway!
dominions 12 we finally get to customize regalia on flags
paid dlc banners
doesnt abysia have like a bowl of fire
dominions five: flags of the faith dlc pack 400 kroner
im just gonna sit in my forts and grumble
yeah, but that's on top of the flag
flags of the faith *content pack
you have a bowl
he has a birb
easy
when i'm zoomed out, they all look the same to me. they even have some lavapeeps too
are you literally max zoomed out
well ragha can afford like 2 birb and nothing else
you have black border they light blue or gray or idk
i hope these fire birbs are gonna be worth it
maybe you too will get a dark vines cap siege luck event
they wont
alongside 5 wells of pestilence on your cap
wait hold up do horrors persist
if i spam send horror will i be unable to take the provinces myself
sometimes
well, hope that helps
send horror horrors only stay for one battle
horror cult horrors have no propriety and will loiter until you kill them
jsoh did you really sign up for two pythium games at the same time
absum has send horror kill him
im fuckin dead in one of them
so yeah
did you use the same god
no
constant iterative improvements guy here
would it be more or less balanced if send horrors persisted on the map
you cant take the province, but neither can your enemy
one huge thing i changed is my god has earth 2 instead of not having earth 2
lol jsoh yeah i defintely have blood 8 or whatever
uh... yeah. i can imagine sending horror a billion times to someone's capital
if you cant kil la fucking horror by the time someone has blood 9 you are a fucking dipshit boing
and then laughing
did u ever hear of the story of how samog cast send horror at his own capital a billion times
and we all laughed
that's a good story
wait...how?
c, navigate down blood
samog was bogarus
go to "send horror"
click on own capital
he had very many fire birds
so i sent 4 dark servants with bane venom charms ot kill his fire birds
lol
or, i guess, the samog banner

so mari c'tis and what else are picked?
or am i missing something
why isnt gath good
abysia
uruk
they have giant sacreds
yeah
and recruit anywhere sacreds
also blood
blood is good
oceania then
gath is bad
yeah but: why
a lack of things that are good
they probably smack on the bad nations of ea
but they are not good in la
cmon
gath is bad kremath
their buildings cost too much
>:c
ok doing the map now i'll post the info in 1 minute
their mages cost too much
their only ranged national is a slinger
in la
their mages are not good
ranged is poopoo anyway
why are their mages bad
i'm shitting right now
i can tell i am reading them
so i cant really look at the mod inspector
hah
but
iirc they are not diverse, are expensive
i tried destruction, burning ones still rip ass and cause you to rout
whats the name of the spell that makes the whole battlefield stinky
or are cap only
foul vapour
s
best strat is like rain and earth meld/tangle if you can
mske em tired
im gonna be ea ulm
does ea ulm just mass steel maidens and get buffs plus earth battle magic
also summons but a lot of them
probably
i won a blitz as them
the heat may rip through swarm if you don't have rain
my recommendation is to have cataclysm happen and kill every one elses thrones first
steel maidens shoulda been their bless unit tbh
server snek.earth port 30059
their bless unit is the shaman
5 points to win, 7 thrones, cataclysm on turn 47, magic sites 52% üëΩ
but yeah steel maidens are kickass
why is tien chi open?
on the other hand, female_death_scream.wav
i didnt know how to make cartographic revision only do 5 players
ok if i do jomon what do i even do ehh
ah cool
so i just picked something that hopefully wouldnt create a second ocean or cave range
ok im a shitty host and ive never done this before so just say now if you've already uploaded
i like that ur changed the name of sirrushes
uploaded
but in the nation desc still calls them sirrushes
uploaded
is this a mod thing?
<@275205678010859520> snek.earth 30059
yep
i see 5/5
we all good?
i am ready
server is started
ready
probably
the nation description for this is stolen from the arch retard zonk
can you guys connect
who stole it from someplace else probalby
i broke
not anymore no
im trying again
at the moment no
the game is probably just setting up
give it a minute
ramc
i have an extremely powerful jomon strat
ok
i dont know if people use the snek servers for blitz
so idk how it will go
is uruk less bad than ur
it is unheard of
it is: take an astral 8 pretender who sleep or whatever, so you have arcane finesse and farcaster
check on snek to see if theres a message about stpos error or something
i had to remake the map when i hosted a game
and then have a pen boosted range 7 permanent charm h1f1 spell
i already took ur
jerek
ok i fixed the problem
give ur dudes the range boost spells
the problem was i did not press 'start game'
that seems cornercase
acutrally is it h1 primary
yeah
because i dont know if theres a range boost for holy
sad
in uruk we have invented helmets
there are range boost spells now?
all the ritual range hats
give spell range
it's not a ritual
helmets? whoa
haha
there it goes
fuckkk
it's a 0 fatigue battle spell
give spell range, in battle
im in
ohhh
cool
25% i think
hmmm
ill sign up as uruk
it could be range like 10 if not holy primary
op
just upload
i'm in
ill do it after the blitz
good luck
anyway i'm labysia
uruk is very bad i think but they have
turn timer is set for an hour
so i can't use powerful jomon strat but
yep
big powerful gamer forts
in
i think you could go around and harvest free titans
if you were extremely lucky
and probably steal your neighbors sacreds when they came to kill you
yeah the throne titans are known to walk into range 7 and then wait for someone to win a roll
instead of casting a aoe 40 damage spell
shhhh
2 water thrones hooray
seriously
fucking game
if there was a 3rd i could just grab it and cast sea of ice
so yeah gath is bad because their only mage that isnt cap only that can reliably cast a spel lyou want to cast is a heretic
whos also a giant
ez game, never lose
that costs 160 gold
lol
dont let water hitlers get an easy win
oh i guess you can communion sibyls
im declaring war on oceania right now for being a water picker
time 2 blind expand into the throne in my cap circle
wish me luck
sibyls are cool
ganbarre
that sounds inadvisable
yeah they're good!
i have never played uruk befor eso i dont know what to expect from them expansion wise
slingers killed my death explosion vicar who was sitting in the middle if my crossbowmans
but then you are a giant using a human mage for everything , and that human mage has no diversity
and also your buildings cost a billion gold
does gath still ahve super expensive forts acutally
maybe they are not as bad as they used to be
rip
rip
giant sneaking retards, a good nation
600 gold palisade but 800 gold temple
larrydavidgnon
hmm okay keep distance makes archers retarded
i have successsfully expanded into a swamp. behold!
sobek sacred guards seem really good but uhh not 1/month good
is ethereal + blood vengeance less dumb than it was
did they fix the order of operations
don't tell me blood vengence triggered before ethereal ignored the damage
in dominions 4 it sure did
enkidu are prety good
a thing of beauty
they fixed it
good
time to change my bless tho
the new hotness is luck+blood bond abuse
luck blood bond regen
hah i set my flags to attack rear against archers, they didnt start shooting until it was too late
hm
like that orc berserker in the lotr movie who blows up the castle
luck+blood bond so that no one ever dies?
lol
woah i got the rare and highly prized 7 point marshmaster
who would win a province full of indies or a couple of very hot boys
everybody loses in that case
luck negates hits that do as much damage or more than your current hp , disregarding that you will share up to half the damage with your friends
so yeah
how hot are we talking
hot as lava baby
if they arent barabrians you miht be ok
is that a virtue
you sick fuck
lmao
my army just got eaten by crocodiles

yes, also screwed up my formation and blew up most of my own army
got to pay more attentin
but it's okay they all go to paradise
(redeemable iou subject to victory in the ascension war)
so theres no way to resist curse
or horror mark
good.
very good yes
need to get as low health units as poss
also how does a unit with luck ever die then?
gosh, one random flaggy wandered into my pike formation and i was shitting bricks, but luckily he didnt detonate
they'll get to 1hp then no hit will affect them
igdi
it only negates 75% of hits
i see
and it doesnt work on like, poison
or bleeding
or being on fire
brb casting luck on all my blood bond regen garms
yeah its not so good on giants
becuase they wil lget arms fall off and stuff before they die
still good though, makes that last bit of health last 4 times as long
if you get hit for hits of 5 damage, so that it kicks in at 5hp it's still +15 hp on average
npt
works well with regen
its real good against evocations
oh no i missed a blitz
how is it going
helll yeah
just checked on my sacred sobek wariors
and every single one of them is cursed with afflictions to boot
sweet
what are good luck spells
rip
i have s3 with boosters, and s1 and s2 native
sry for long turn i am retarded
jotun right
u can just stack hags
battle fortune is aoe 5
uruk im going for prov 74, you ok with that? it's next to my virtue and your army
will of the fates is entire fight
its very close to my cap but sure, expanding has been bad
sacred sobek commanders have like 15 less hp than the sacred sobek troops
same guy. one is a commander though. games rigged.
ma c'tis: thug nation? we report, you decide.
enkidu? more like, enkidon't fuck with me
we peaceful ichtycentuars mean no harm
wishlist: color coded dominion
it gets thicker when its stronger
seduction is really uneliable, my troubadous have mainly been getting rebuffed by dudes instead of seducing the throne sorceress
sobek commanders just have no shield
a falchion is a 1h weapon! you idiots!
o fuck
i just opened a battle replay and elephants everywhere
i actually expanded ok with ur
dat infrastructure cost tho
keep in mind
first fort u make has command point obnus

also lol that 2 of us named our pretenders after simpsons references
time to join a new game obviously
i know but there aren't any pending games
theres a pending game! join my bad nations game
where is the list
wait i got your prophet and pretender mixed up
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/372490951391838221/406973373030203403/lzigxzd.png
hmm how did my prophet get horro mrked
oh well im sure nothing will come of it
lol
my prophet got cursed the first turn
and has battle fright since the crocs
abysia what are you doing
maybe you didnt know that province belonged to me
abysia what is your god
oh man
next version wont have la abysia
and ctis? i assume those troops are just passing through
is this on brainwrinkle?
and maybe not ea abysia either
no
you know
brainwrinkle is too much effort
for a not ea game
they just might be
just conenct ot snek.earth 30058 and upload
then c laim ur dudes on the robot
pythium is bad?
la pythium? yes
but maybe will be removed from bad list
oh man
lemme decide here
marginal is not bad
very tempted to do ys
ys or patala
i gotta go. does anyone want to take on my uruk disaster?
i did not pw the pretender
oh yeah dont pick a water nation probably
do you like doing a mega bless?
because im not going to do anything to the map to make water nations playable
it's a pity that my death explosions wont be useful against the lavamen
but i also took charged bodies as a backup plan
fuck water nations.
<@&389927677416701952> anyone wanna fill in for uruk - hasnt been ruined yet! turn 15
walks into completely empty room
guess this is mine now
wasnt there a guy who wanted to blitz and just missed it
idk about uruk mage paths are weird
<@233383745779007499>
im gonna look into mictaln as well
i am trying to build a god for the badnations game
i am occupied!
rip
also if you pick ys or patala i want the other one
if you're torn i'd rather have pat
yeah if you cant find anyone in like ~5 mins just go ai
need to go so im just gonna set now
gandjalf be patala
i will be...caelum maybe?
that cost me a lot of glod.
wait jsoh
doesnt that mean all uw nations are a badnation and therefore pickable?
:))))
cmon jsoh
theres some in bad nations
that you can pick
but you will probably be in a 1 provincel kae
lake
not bad for theredos tbh
therodos is not a bad nation
noice
ok
loook at the list https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/372490951391838221/406973373030203403/lzigxzd.png
caves are enabled on the map right jsoh?
im going to generate a random map
with generic starts
theres an option for "enable caves/rivers"
from the cartography maker
oh
not the game thing
then there should be caves right?
corbeaus thing
i dont know
theres caves if the game asks for it
ma oceania
my god
but it probably wont put you in a cave
yeah i just want caves to exist if i pick patala
like, at least a few?
not necessarily my cap or anything
idk
try a few
see what happens
oof
ma tc is bad?
ma tc is bad
if you disagree feel free to sign up as them and prove me wrong
stunned by ea r'leyh not being on this list
not that i want to play as them but just in principle
no thanks, i'm already playing them in another game well and (imo) doing decent, so seeing them on the list surprised me.
ea ryleh isnt on the list because samog made it be only amphibious water nations
non amphibious water nations are too shit to play
caelum makes me so mad just because they have a million gosh darn units
ok
start a game as ur
uruk&
*
and look at how many commanders you have
and then, understand that theres even more if you go under water
oh god
why would you make me look at this
i may go oceania just because they have like 5 units
even though they are all awful
again, you will be shit upon
because yo will not have any water to play in
that is a good thing
actually i dont even know if it will allow you to play a water nation on one of these
jsoh i have made up my mind to make a bad decision i choose oceania or maybe not i am still kind of undecided
i'm  really screwing up by the numbers here
im going to test a map if its even allowed
nope
no water
unless i edit the map
which i adamantly refuse to do , fuck to water
virtue is pretty good against abysians because fire reist and shock ave
so no jomon and no oceania
jomon is fine
time to go with my 3rd choice
ugh without shark people?
it just will not allow you to start in water
because the map sets starting positions
oooh alright
and none of them are in the tiny lakes it generates
there will be lakes
these undead.
<@153656281448710145> plz make all ages setting for map maker program please i love u
this is only the second game of dom i've ever played and it's pretty late for me.
good to know though
thats a lot of crossbows
i just got a bunch of free troops from the throne of bones
awesome
almost makes up for these endless rebellions
abysian have tower shields so crossbows arent much good
already who else needs to upload.
wut
if u upload please tell the robot who you are playing thank you
!register gath bad
<@110124675580862464>: registering nation gath for user atlanton
i win in two turns
no kidding please
this is a serious battle
did somebody let oceania get three thrones
i don't know why i didn't expect your pretender to join the fun
i set them to attack
must have messed up the order
she decided to chuck fireball instead
we can put a halt to this war briefly and deal with cryle
someone is friggin oceania
what is going on here
oh man i gotta run out i will return to pick a nation
sure
i will probably make a panic choice of caelum
c'tis is amazing. best ma nation.
nobody 'let
me take those thrones haha
ctis attacked 2/3 of them
somehow i'm guessing c'tis isn't winning this turn since his turn wasn't super quick
im fine
its fucking fine

lol
too many skellies
i'm toast and tired
gg yo
i need to lose a game first im not going to join
should we just call it at this point? getting a little tired myself.
so whats going on right now
is the turn i claimed the water throne for 5
the enkidus won a siege on my other 2 pter
and now theyre just sitting there
and im sick of this shit too
so yeah
<@282646158218756116> will you be pythium, again
ai power
gg all wish it had a better ending
yeah two turns after he leaves
suddenly theres like 6 armies of 190 enkidus
sure
i guess ill call it then
same thing happened to me but chariots
kicked me off of land entirely nearly
the resource bonus ai gets must be huge
cuz he was 1:1 matching my pale riders, and i was making 100 a turn

i want to make a golem
the most sweet ass golem ever made
my big mistake
my biggest mistake, imo, is thinking that non-carnute troops are worth making
well i've got 300 of them to send into the abysia blender and they will not be fucking missed
lol.
!details

ass golem.
<@179427307386044416> lol, they were just passing through.  but yeah, that was p funny.  they're suicide bombers!
hello who is the dispel caster
did someone say ass golem?
ermor's whoooole again. and then it brooooke again.
ya
cadmus you're ulm right?
yup
ok i am going to attack the throne at 8 this turn with a lot of guys
so please do not move onto it
i don't thiiink i am. pretty sure i'm not
would you like some endless bag of wine items for your siege of ermor? (this reduces the amount of guys who are going to get fucked up by being hungry)
oh i've already made some but thx
okay who claimed the bone boy throne
ok i will send some anyway b/c i'm sure they will be handy in future for you moving thru all that garbage land with 0 pop
yuuuup
and i'll die soon after cause 15 provs worth of 0. but if i kill that damn ant lion i'll be happy
https://vgy.me/jvqwap.jpg lmao 974 kills
did they earthquake 40 casts of creeping doom or something
ok so
it casts body ethereal
and invulnerability
and flies into melee
that was amazing
lmao
i didnt even gget to that battle yet
oh yeah it is chaos
gonna watch it on slowspeed to actually see anything
press x for super slo mo
why can't there be repop events srsly
yeah you called it
exactly
eq into creeping doom
those poor bugs
i made a v popular mod that did this in dom 4 and it is updated to dom 5
but we did not use it due to idk why
you were way off on what a throne sphinx does tho
also throne sphinx paths are like f3 s5d5
for the same reason we didn't foreverban ermorn i guess
did it cast solar eclipse into living fires or some garbage?
ya mistake's
no it cast
body ethereal
invunerability
something elsei  didnt catch
and then attack rear
lmao
powerful
also sorry for almost samoging like every turn
but this is just when i wake up
in dom4 i would have 2 extremely highly experienced mallqui but alas
those hurin priests were from uruk and have died
im just happy i haven't died already
lasted longer than my dom3 games
joining in on the 3v1 forever war
kind of does that
dogpile the op
agartha is quite stronger than me now i think
im just much better at dominions and specifically at nazca
this games so good actually
its like turn 40something and the only global up is riches from beneath
that was cast by accident
hmbol
wait how the hell was there troops from 3 factions in 1 battle?
troops from man, troops from nazca, and province defense from uruk?
province defense from uruk, controlled by nazca
oh ok
the province uruk
ya
gotcha
fucked up that neither of the earth quakers even got in the hall of fame for that
man why did no one make them make ac harder to cast
tried
its a really huge change that i dont get to have every single mage ive recruited for the entire game come to my cap when they die
do they go to where they're from?
yes
so theres no concentration of litrearlly 200 guys making skeletons
ya
and you don't own that anymore
same is true of immortals
hm
if you don't own it you lose them
interesting
also twiceborn outside of your own dominion even
i notice that badnations is using silt also yeah?
yep
so like i can't just make an infinitude of vampires as abysia
correct
a mod that makes a nation less bad goes against the spirit of badnations imho
uhh
or like the class of infinitude of vampires i can make
its ahuge nerf to blood nations
is smaller
and doesnt make anyone better
big nerf to death and blooders
it in fact makes many of the nations significantly worse
generally inconvenient if not huge to pan
yeah i think you're thinking of the yomimod
ah rip got it confused with another mod then
probably
its late
which is fair because the game using that uses both
why is it called silt
google salt
table salt, hollywood movie...
bitcoin lending...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_arms_limitation_talks
google ron paul
ah
cool
poison weapons probably doesn't add to existing poison values on a weapon right
it just adds a new small one?
although i guess poison is armor negating so unless they have resist the second one would be better anyway
it is 5 poison on i think damage as an additional affect to things that don't already have too many effects
it definitely will roll for multiple weapon effects now
i tested that
let's say i hypothetically have a poison dagger wielding man who can be blessed
he should already have an identical poison effect
except a higher number then 5 why is it 5 illwinter
the way the game handles some numbers (fire shield for example) you might expect it to stack
and become oldpoison +5
i bet it doesn't do that though
if poison weapons were poison 15 or 20 they probably still wouldn't be too powerful
yes they would lol
they definitely would
i would bow of war that shit and instantly destroy aulm etc.
it still has to do damage, or do you mean ea ulm
and you have to take death
i guess they would probably want to be nature 6
and incarnate
solar weapons are bugged, yeah?
if grazing a human did instantly fatal damage i think it would be quite strong
poison damage takes multiple rounds always
yeah but
they are not going to hit the same guy every time
just take unaging + poison weapons
on like , fuckin ma man
and monk the shit out of people
i mean you could already do that with decaying, or do they not generally age a normal human enough to kill them?
love 2 see the dom 3 mods people behind such good silt opinions as "you kind of broke undead nations with this" believing that ma man monks are bad in their zonkmod opinions
poison weapons doesnt have an mr check
decay you at least get an mr
ya
checks out
i just feel like most of the stuff in the game that has poison weapons has posion 10+ because less than that doesn't do much
i guess i am mostly thinking of assassins tho
bow of war is construction 6 actually rip
yeah i basically tried that strat a couple times in blitzes as caelums
and you can kind of do a hilarious bow of war thing eventually
but it takes too long to be practical
quickness bless doesnt work for archers does it
it does!
pretty sure
hard to tell i guess
well they don't do the old thing where they wiggle closer
man i really want to take death explosion
in a game at some point
it's so bad
it is probably a top 5 most awful bless alongside the somewhat misleadingly described auras in the "best" heat/cold, poison weapons, and death weapons
blood bond also pretty shit tbf
it would be good for chinas or sauro if there was a better way to bless friends over and over
than having your god be there
or having someone scripted to cast divine blessing five times
or whatever
for china you take a bishop fish w/ you and cast divine blessing x5
sauro's not so good for it tho ya
blood bond is good
its good for luck abuse!
blood bond is i think very bad for sacred mages see also berserk bless
to the point i would probably not take them if they were free on some factions
75% chance to not die to something that would actually not kill you anyway
<:wow:372896749716504588>
for sure its bad on some guys
i think blood bond+ regen + fuckkkkin air shield would be good on nazca
since i assume blood bond doesnt work on things what do have blood
"good"
quickness is acutally just so much stronger than every other bless its kind of silly
<@255835336083636234> can u make robot give turn numbers when it dms me
so like "turn 43 for nazca in warcrimes"
or something to this effect
sure not hard
also want to add "3/12 submis
make it also say 3/12 submitted if six people submit partial turns, so its ambiguous and frustrating
https://twitter.com/ayocaesar/status/957549284555218944?s=09
the uhhh
marverni guys with javelin and no armor used to be cool
can immobile and lifeless tiny idiot nerds turn into vampires in silt mod
repop events üëé
not fucking allowing people to play popkill nations üëç
yeah, i aied as ys because i'm built around sacred cap-only units with a double-incarnate bless
on an immobile pretender stuck without troops inside a cap under siege
yes but that is not down to the mod's code but rather illwinter being slack arsed
please dont turn a demilich into a real lich
in my game at least
its rude.
just a matter of time without any advantages, but agartha and ermor were the only nations in the game that could threaten enough uw troops to do that
i had a strat to avoid that, but the strat turned out to be terrible
i'm gonna turn him into a vampire
your banned
basically i went for something not named "living water" for my water mages
lol jk this memebless i am building will probably never reach vampire wizard make
deserved result
what if i turned a fountain into a worm man
again, rude
not really sure where the confusion lies here
samog join the bad nations game
then the fountain would write two million words of bad fiction
oh, is there a bad nations game?
yes
maybe
how do we know what's a bad nation in dom5?
im going to sleep though
whats the lizard from?
intuitively, corbeau
its whatever jsoh decided
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/372490951391838221/406973373030203403/lzigxzd.png
tbh pan seems legit weaker now, at least, though still good
no
you are wrong
the stare emote
no pan is not weaker
pan is not weaker
is it not?
not at all
pan has seemed to struggle in research in the games i've seen
yes...
the royal family
corbeau the bad nations game is slightly stymied by the lack of an all ages setting for the map robot
otherwise they seem even better, but their momentum is less good
_sighs as he draws his codetana_
fine, i hear you
alternative to that image is you can look in the <#401498099622608911> channel and download the bad nations mod
and see which nations are in it
i could even just put together a map for you from a hacked in version of the current build
i don't have mekone in the current database anyway
what would be good
shouldnt it have a crown or something?
what's mekone's start bias, if any?  they seem like they have none
i think mekone doesnt give a heck about terrain mostly
it does, on the top of its head
it looks like thats just part of the fancy robe
i think they would prefer to start adjacent to but not actually in a mountain
so they could search it for e/f sites
what kind of reptillian royal doesnt have jeweled scepters and crowns n shit?
and have resources
also have res ya
isnt irl sparta mountainous? i guess all of greece is
not really mountains
hills
much of greece is quite mountainous
well ok but like rugged hills
there are legit mountains in balkan greece
sissy european mountains
but a lot less in like the pelopones and shit
i would describe it as definitely rugged in the peleponese
unless they have units or spells that dictate it, or fluff that specifically mentions it, i'm reluctant to hardcode it
i went there for the 2004 olympics
theyve neithewr
arco is also greek, but doesn't start in mountains

do you have a wasteland bias for nazca
even though athens would, in dominions terms, start as coastal with nearby mountains
its just mountains for them right
gandalf almost all of it is like driving around the edge of a hill m8
with occasional fields
tbf thats like every coastal european city
also the roads all have shrines every 20 feet where some poor fucker went off the side
tiny streets on cliffs
nice is like that
the idea of international travel to go see the olympics is fucking wild
gibraltar and malta are fuckin insane for cliffs and shit roads
i didnt even have an inkling of want to go to vancouver
gibraltar fuckin sucks
agreed
it's like every english naval town but 100 times worse
the british should have burnt it to ash
due to also attracting tourists
and left it barren
it's seriously like warm blackpool with some monkeys
what is there even to see in gibratr
it's got a hill and some monkeys
why would you not go to spain instead
you would go to spain instead
the most dangerous major airport on earth
i guess if you murder someone in spain, as a uk citizen
you shuold go to gibraltr
i went to the south of spain which is great and we went on a day trip to gibraltar since it is tiny and there is p much no border and it is a shit hole
they even have their own monopoly money pounds
which they will happily swap sterling for
what is mekone's nation id number?
32
also im attempting to not use brainwrinkle for this bad nations game
so if you wanna play in it just connect to 30058 and upload then sign up on the robot
jsoh as a briton going to greece on holiday is quite normal and the olympics more or less coincided with that
added to database
so it is not so wild as a concept imo
ive been to one place on holiday in my life tbh
and it was the next province over
too poor to travel
until i wasnt anymore, and now im too depressed to travel
i have not been on a holiday abroad since a teenager lol
ive been east and west one province
which in european terms is like the distance from brittany to the rhine probably idk
last trip out the country was a high school equivalent trip to auschwitz which had honestly such a bad landing coming back into leeds-bradford airport that it pretty much turned me off flying, which i did not enjoy very much before, completely
ragha is mountain and currently has no desert affiliation
oh, you asked about nazca
probably the same and just a coincidence i ended up next to a wasteland
nazca is mountain, but not wasteland
the desert was pure chance then, yes
wasteland is a good thing to start near as nazca no?
due to geoglyph
they have a wasteland spell
lol if u are ugnna fuckin
research that
18 pearls and requires a boosted coya to cast it
and enchantment 5
make the mod they need: 1 rec point paqos, so you can play them like very very strong la pythium and have a geoglyph for them to research in
thats a entire huaca
i wish there was a way that you could mod boy pacos to get stronger from being hit by lightning bolt or tstrike
<@110869804197351424> i'm going to make it so that 50% of partial turns show, so if you had 2 submitted and 6 partials it'd show 5/8 :dev

time to get rekt as this shit nation
pros: good forts for other people to effortlessly take over
cons: 1850 gold to recruit a mage
fucked up that i didnt secretly insert code to give yomi the good realm 1 pretenders
or sneak yomi mod into bad nations code
ur don't get sacred buffalos do they
just regular ones
nobody has sacred buffalo's as far as i know
how will you possibly pick between your like 14 fucking mages
all of them complete dreck
i bet that nation has enough water mages to defend a throne against cataclysm
if they had turned out to be sacred buff' i think this would be my pg
probably lots of thug potential for your uhhh
i have no idea what that nations mages are
guy who's a melia
but larger
they have air guy?
is air guy sacred
every mage is sacred
a huge boon on this 600g temple faction
lol
as if you ever get a second fort
you have i think 4 potential a1 mages
lol
take the extremely strong like 6 reinvig 30 bonus hp bless
holy shit 600g temples
how did i not notice that
and just never use chaff
i was wrong jsoh
5
5 a1 mages
only 2 of which are underwater only
uruk is so good
<@&372528101076500482>#5392 abandon all plans for everyone is nazca game and just make a everyone is uruk game
uruk looks like a astral communion nation
the rest of their paths suck
uruk loos like... as...
you should do the eligist play
love the n1 spell singer
huh
they don't have a non-mage priest do they
no
so you can't recruit priests without a lab?
correct
other than indep
which if you do you should delete your game probably
at least they figured out how to make helmets finally
uruk is such a fucking mess
this is legitimately about the 2nd time i've ever even looked at them
b/c ur was test shit nation
if you have high scales you can make a shitload of chaff
i fought like 20 uruk mages i think
and this is just awful shit nation
yeah cool... chaff..
due to their low recruitment points for sizeable hp bags
and i dont know if i could tell you what they do
stand in front of huge fuckoff communions that you recruit from you super expensive mage factories that you got somehow
their forts give like 150% bonus rec points
and 60 admin
so you can make a shitload of chaff either way
they have some kinda spooky longbows i guess?
big news from 2001
i seduced something successfully
, a pale one commander
just saw some one  on twitter named mao zedong thot
ok i think i have a plan in this game if everyone just lets me get to constr 6
high quality shit

probably better on ulm
undoubtedly
is uruk god even inert? i know they have elegist on 1 (one) priest mage
i think so
holy shit, oceania's infantry is undisciplined
hoping that you get extremely bad events if you don't have an ensi in every fort
that's
uh
wow
oceania can fuck right off tbh that is not a cool nation at all
wish they'd deleted it
why not heat for fire repel
or is uruk heat pref
to make invading me slower jsoh and it's heat 1 pref
also i have 0 fire mages but lots of water mages
good to be assigned the wrong mage temp
the play there is your water 1 and or air 1 guys casting one self buff and standing in a pike line
along with ur sacreda
breath of winter, instantly devastating the pike line
or just
how do i sign up
body ethereal
upload a pretender
and register to the robot
is there any reason why a lizard shamen would go off script and not be a communion slave
or is ma man bugging out
they are not allowed
to join mans song communions
no no
just normal communion
with other lizards
maybe man's just broke
ma man is currently not allowed to cast any holy spells either i think
report it maybe
i thin because i had other man mages coing chorus things on the same battlefield>
yeah that would do it
but whyy
there's only one communion a side
i have deleted the good bull god and replaced it with a better god for uruk i think
plus my pig went off script
and got stabbed to death by merrow
how did they go off script
lmao
i'm dying
.tag fauxbot lost to merrow
he was going to cast temper flesh  +  personal regen
as he has done before
but just did not
routed them
then bed to death
did he get punched
*bled
i mean he got stabbed a bunch for like 1 hp by like 30 merrow
pig is berserk a lot so if he got hit before castinf his spells then he would go berserk and not br allowed to cast spells
my suggestion: cast gonb/regen first
i'm gonna double check but i don't think he got hit by spells
gonb?
generic overused bounty
the e/n nature battle path booster that also gives regen
oh the booster spell
ok there weren't any mages
he just.. prepared to cast then didn't
it's actually called strength of gaia i think in the small one
man is currently fucking broke as shit
ya
because the song communions are poorly implemented
screenshot and report i think
god i've been having fun in more-turns too
but it's hard to want to play when i am losing to shinuyama
partly because i'm bad
but also partly because of bugs
so salty
where do i report stuff?
steam discusso
man imagine how good that fight where i killed almost a thousand bugs would have been if i had reanimator bless
now i want thunder weapons quicknes reanimator on nazca
jsoh put your game on brainwrinkle imo
why
!details bad

i've got 8 sign up's without it
and the numbers not lining up is a pain in the ass
oh shit this might change the lobby game
actually nah becaus eyou have to upload first before doing anything
nm
you can upload a random pretender to save your spot then make an actually final one layer
later
bc you have to spam the bot to find out how much time is left on the turn
boing make a new brainwrinkle site.
samogbot lobbies should do it

jsoh win theodoros game faster!!
agreed i am doing my best to lose but i am still hanging in there
i dispelled last time.
but yeah, just letting ermor get picked basically blew out this game's kneecaps.
how bad is ea ermor
compared to, say, la bogarus
do you put a bless on your stupid knights so your efficient researchers can survive to cast spells
idk
i dont think it matters much
bc im dead regardless
!details

haha jesus christ
dead pretenders that come back can carry over cursed
fucked up
i assume you want some path diversity on your pretender because you don't get much on your actual mages
my internet died
but anyway yeah afaik your normal troops are good enough for expansion in ea and blessed ponies wont really beat any real bless i think
theyre pretty good vs uuh other weak humons maybe
like in badnations?
oh this is badnations?
uuuh
then maybe consider bless ye
idk im not that good at the game that i can really say more
instead of throwing dead cattle over the walls you throw a single amoral dude who likes to drink blood
https://imgur.com/edit?deletehash=7wl2wenapjdiqrh
lol
does ea abysia get blood sac?
yes
he's doing it
i guess that makes you the lesser evil, since you don't get h3's like he does
my sac is barely keeping candles in my own forts
abysia is doing it and marverni has been pushing candles as hard as he can
yeah. i think the rus time to shine has passed.
which is why i'm knocking his shit over
fucking temples
you have an enormous pile of shit i assume you can hurt someone with it if you so choose
should probably start acquiring thrones
yeah. i probably should
i feel like rus shouldn't go turmoil 3
with its poop forts
why does that matter
troops are dumb
maek wizard
i only have wizard
i am making like 5 troops a turn and i debate turning that off every turn
im dumb with scripting and when i attack with unchaffed mages, some dude just walks up and stabs
i probably should just swarm/ele more
is it possible to make 2 much wizard? ü§î
if its the wrong wizard
for example, the rusian wizard has more upkeep per turn than the thunder priest
if you only make rusian wizards, you will have no gold, a lot of research, and 0 mages to cast useful shit with
i have decided
i will hit 'r' 5 times
o dear
and on the 5th random god i will upload it to the badnations game
perfection

rad
holy heck
this is kind of a rad god
!details

!details

should definitely name him "i pressed r five times"
or alternately keep the random name and name your prophet that
nice <@255835336083636234>
is it ready for launch? üòÆ
should also have like some info to type in abt the game like "no water nations, my name is jsoh" etc
i think i am going to lose a game i had in the bad due to being too sick to script shit properly lol
in the bag*
well
how viable is a dom score of 3
which game and can i have your stuff
65% spread chance
no it's not <@68614451045076992> , still working on it. the code is so bad i have to improve it because it's stopping my from making the changes i want
probably viable if you don't give a shit about sacreds
ah ok
5h hmm
<@114740794476331015>
meksevik not very
3 is a bit small of a domscore window i think
4 is prob fine tho
hows this ea ermor god
no +2 def?
what would you replace for def
strength and mountain survival
im not convinced by blood surge
strength is v good imo
you should be
with multiple attacks and attack skill and magic weapons
strength is not the best when you have half of your damage being innate nostr added
strength does not make hoof better
hmm dnag.
solar weapons are bugged
so do not take that
that is 1/3rd of damage though right
arent they just bugged if they have fr
or do guys drop their light lances now
<@!148098869782118401> affliction resistance is good
conot ermor has healers
equites already have recuperation i think
and recup on equites
and healers yea
yeah afflictions is not a problem
defense is your do not die stat though
some afflictions are shed but cursed/horror always stay
so +2 would be good
i am gonna be so salty if i lose la game to puke shamecube
ea game*
also global casting order luck
3 in all elements for +2atk, +30% move, +5 shock res, +2def, +2strength
blood surge
ah, yeah, if they already have recup then
if it's a game with idiot fuckers who require magic weapons you can flip blood surge to s4
is there a therodos or somebody
you mean 4 right
no
3
if you have 3 in all elements you get 3 bless points in all
really??
yes. same with sorcery
the rainbow special
fuck
if you are fighting asshole ghosts move blood surge to magic weapons and magic resist
you should be able to just threaten them by having this and have them fuck off
!bad
!details bad

i wanted s2 so i can forge crystal coins but i guess i dont need the astral bless.
just yomi and marverni
no one else would really care about magic wep
marverni has ghosts?
marverni has tattoo
invuln is negated by magic weapon
oh i wondered what tattoo spell did
sounds cool
both s4 or b4 are valid so you can probalby just pick one
i didnt know about rainbow element bless, good idea thank
surge really does own though
i forgot equite have a broadsword
with surge up it's 15 str 16atk 21def
in testing it seems surge is up for only 1-2 rounds at a time
and never when you need it
it's for fighting chaff
since you need it when you're whacking on some dude that wont die without it
it makes you not tired while cutting thru chaff
it's not for big strong things
with the reinvig?
or just the improved kill rate on idiot militiamen
and the stats so even with fatigue you still hit and kill rate is better
the extra defense is also an attrition reduction for expansion
marv tattoo spell is great, it's essentialy 15 invuln
if you were building for fighting asshole big strong things probably just slap unholy on them
the problem is surviving long enough to get to cast it
it's only ench3 and with pigu no one is fucking with you that early
and if they are able to kill pigu, 15 invlun wont save you either
boing attacked me on turn 12
and killed me with pony men in three turns
vanhere will be vanhere
that wasnt badnations
vanhere killing everything forever is just one of those auto lose conditions
0 points yas
why not go heat 1 growth 3
boing no heat three
or at least that
or heat 3
and then o1p1g3
i had a 0 point god for marv. after last game, i decided to drop magic 1 and +natural protection for blood venge
to burn people better?
thats a nice idea
you have fire magic and fire eles are your defense backstop
heat 3 is good
true i didnt think about elementals
why not imprisoned?
it does hurt income a lot though and i want many mages
because rp
to benefit from my magic3 and inspiring rp god
it does not hurt income a lot. you are a math person
figure out the cost to income over 12 months with h3 vs h0
including temp shifts due to season
i actually did model this once
also keep in mind the o1p1 bonuses to income and the good events in terms of gold they unlock
and esp g3 bonus
and i really like going weather3 on nations with temp preferences in general
growth 3 is the everything
wouldn't h3 end up burning down lots of labs tho
no. maybe a couple over the course of the game
no
when it happens you will be extremely annoyed but it doesn't happen that often
only time its really goddamn annoying is on your cap
and cold 3 can be "lol thousands of people died"
otherwise it's eh
and my cap has a huge pile of augurs to avoid bad events!
synergy
cause you have dat sweet gold income from g3
so you buy a new lab
ok im sold
i have a suspicion prod2 is better than ord1 prod1
it is not
wtf are you going to buy with prod2
bc my troops are resource intensive and i get rec points from growth indirectly
hastati
also mages
your best troop costs one resource point
gladiators??
yes. didn't you see the changes they made
they have to actually fight to vanish
get hit or hit somebody
rec points should store in a province imo
they were going to actually jonjoe but illwinter half assed it an released it anyway'
thats good but im not sure its enough to sell me on gladiators
except as a last ditch defense if i need to mass many troops suddenly
boing gladiators win you your first early war
oh my god really, nuclear?
what am i missing about gladiators
that would actually make recpoints not suck ass
rec points did not store monkee
two attacks at two strength with a 2h weapon (which means 2h wep bonus) that hits at 14 vs a shielded unit
please
get it right
wasn't the intention to have them store
res was going to store
like iron in coe
rec was the new res
which they also didn't do
yes
and in fact just made more obtuse
very good
!unit retiarius
<@148098869782118401>: https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/?page=unit&unitq=retiarius&showmodcmds=1&showmoddinginfo=1&showids=1
regular gladiator
2h weapon with new 2h str bonus they hit hard
6 times per square
accurately
and net ones specialty ruin things like ponies
i use regular ones vs ponies too cause ponies have shields
so they get the attack bonus
ye but throw a few nets in there
you don't need a bunch
you lose horror marks over time when dead now
net is probably going to miss or be glamoured away though
because ponies are bullshit
oh do shields block nets?
that'd be very stupid lol
no you do have to hit them though
10g for a unit you can only use once feels bad to me
do you stick them in the back so your regular troops clean up chaff and you only expend gladiators on big fights or what
you can recruit a shitton of glads in a single turn
early you use gladiators to clear heavy cav and hard stuff that wrecks your romans
and later you can pop out a pile to fuck up aggressors
thats their real strength
or to shove them into the teeth of a proper armie
the fact you can recuit so many at once
gladiators are used to save your real troops
who are harder to replace
though i personally just use gladiators, and also gladiators
ok but prod2 is still better for money and equite recruitment in cap
did someone say
hastatii!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
isn't it just 1% more money
and equite will max out once you connect like one forest
3% per level monkee
2% is order
vs prod
4% is growth
im bitter from my cap in vanheim game only having 3 low res connections so i can only recruit 5 vanheres per turn with 7 dom
fucked up
i will experiment with gladiators though
2x gladiator per heavy cav will clear those provs pretty reliably
with blockers or no
they are the blockers
compelling
if you have no one to kill the rest of the stuff then you probably want an extra per heavy cav
you can always put 1 arrow catcher in front if you want
that doesn't work the ai will ignore him
oh
they fixed that sadly
shame
that is 200-300g to kill a province with 10 heavy cav
which i can probably send 5 equites at and keep afterward
um
your 5 equires are gonna beat 10 heavy cav with no losses?
lol
with my quintuple bless yes
whats the bless
quintuple
which
depends how many heavy cav
and they are more likely to attrition when you roll bad
f3 w3 a3 e3 b4
the thing about gladiators is you can do that and make equite at the same time
that bless bad
sorry boing
i dont think they are more likely to attrition than a unit with 100% attrition rate
ur bad
i am
which is why
i did that bless in a game
as ea ermor
and lost before turn 20
they will attrition 100% but that's okay. the goal is to preserve equites
because they have a recruit cap
not preserve gladiators, which you can instantly replace
how was combat speed + lances changed?
ok i can see your reasoning
i cant find anything in the dom5 manual about lances or charge bonuses
i assume movespeed is still good but it might not be
it's capped by strength or some shit now i dont remember
because i recall equites being murder machines with swiftness and blood surge
>no incarnate blesses what baby trash
quickness bless imo
exactly so i can go dormant and get more scales.
so you can't mount a railgun on a centaur
lol don't do quickness
oh hey lets see how this turn came ooouu....shit me
if equites were good and you had other sacreds besides them, maybe
if theres no incarnate blesses you go imprisoned and get even more blesses
that's a lotta killing
have 9 blesses
that bless is good enough to expand
which is fine
he is cultivating the wasteland
scales imprisoned ermor with rainbow bless is what i'd do
get undying x7
get the health blesses for blood and nature
dormant great sage with magic 3 is my secret rp rush strat
mostly stomping on bugs
but then again, solar weapons are broken too i guess?
"how many blesses are you at"
"idk like 5 or 6"
"u are like a little baby"
solar weapons are only broken if the other guy has fr
pretty much <@179427307386044416>
i only have two blesses
two incarnates, as is correct
i think solar weapons is one of the strongest blesses
because it's a weapon bless that's not incarnate

isn't someone playing ys is this bad game?
lol if you didn't ever run f9w9n9 ma pelagia and kill sceleria in 11 turns with your insanely good sacreds
if you're only having two incarnate blesses they better be quickness and fear
fear is less good
18 fatigue / turn short sword ftw
now
fear isn't that great it seems
being d10
btw does shock resistance actually do anything
and not stacking
it is good just not d10 good imo
yes it resists lightning boing
yeah its a bit underpowered
i have a suspicion elemental resistance is just protection vs elemental attacks and all lightning stuff is an

nice
boing you always roll nowadays but it definitely does help
now if only naksu would fix it so you can do disciple games
lmao
"""""fix""""""
pls
besides something stupid like ermor or lemuria, i don't know what d10 would be actually good on
fear i mean
tc and sauro, kind of
yeah. spooky ghosts
fear i guess is rather just the icing on the cake because d10 is just good by itself
maybe helheim?
if the nation fits it
maybe they figure that the earlier blesses are good enough
and that death shouldn't have too many good bless options
death blesses are kinda lame
654? damn, thats alot of... something...
except the invuln one
did someone say disciple game?
someone should host one of those
next turn should be interesting for me: make-or-break, really
if you're piloting a nation that fits the death blesses they are pretty good i think
fear on helheim you say https://i.imgur.com/u6ctjdn.png
i want a disciple game
but naksu is mean and his computer blew up
pls just get quickness on helheim instead
the other oddness is specific to the game because magic + solar is good and fire res is -2 enc and "don't die to burning one"
does fire res prevent heat exhaustion?
yes
ye
yes
thats neat
cold res doesn't help cold-blooded fuckers tho
it prevents two enc
out of like 12 haha
i will write up my story presently when i am less full of flu
is ma agartha fun? it looks quite cool
also who's up for a new game? this was fun
why solar weapons? i'd imagine that skelli spam would still choke them?
generate another hit on trash while expanding to increase their lethality
solar hoofs
more hits more kills more morale checks
all hail morale minus five, god of helheim
!details bad

what is good ea suro build
there are many choices
u can follow my guide and get 8 provinces in year one
it's very strong
blood surge is pretty good for the oiorpata
if you aren't doing a good bless
ea sauro has many options but you must choose one
there is magic 3 + fort everything so you can make soothsayers
you cant have it all
there is go scales and drown the enemy in armored horsies
there is go some dumb bless like flaming weapons for ancestral ghosts
were i to do it again i would have taken this https://i.imgur.com/vi2w0k5.png
unholy for ancestors and sacreds to kill all of the bullshit in ea
regen is basically for bull man himself to expand
i guess it will reduce oioropata attrition too
which tattoo is the invulnerable one
all o fthem
then what's the difference between horsie and snek
snek is +mr and horse is +move fast
and def i think?
the cataphracts get double horsie tat
it doesnt really matter the important part is 10 invuln on a 0 native prot unit
tattoos are friggin insane lol
particularly when you get it for free and can add bless
glad 2 see illwinter giving sauro the additional buffs it needed after ros was turned into a piece of shit
and its down the tree for skelespam which you want anyways
yeah it's good
now that unholy works vs gods you can probably take someone's god out by just spamming ghosts at it too
which is great
nice
i read a guide that said not to get androphags
archers i mean
aaah misfortune 3
nuclear that looks like madness you would get eaten by random events
misfortune 3 isn't really a big deal
you're going to get poopy events no matter what you do
the scales are curated to avoid the game losing random events
no civil wars no magic fade no freethinker poploss
it's fine
<@96715337440952320> did you notice there is a freethinking poploss for fifteen percent at o2mis2
no turn limit
yes
basically you should stay at o1 t1 or neutral
order scale as a whole is cancer
unless taken with the shit scale of death, ytes
yes*
i will take my turn in 12 minutes.
scale thresholds on events are probably one the dumbest things in the game
in practice
it's fine but whoever made them is dumb
his name is "randomevents"
that was his true name, from birth
i guess he was born to fuck up
the only way to know what to do is to use the mod inspector to sleuth through all the bad events
which is silly
search by poploss
nah once you've played a couple games
you tend to notice things like "holy shit turmoil is fucking aids"
even before the dom 5 inspector was up we got that
tattoo marverni seems good
tattoos are very strong
its basically extra blesses that need a different spell to bless you with
tat / shitty ros marv is better than dom 4 marv
marv is fine now. it has pig. it has tattoos
it can do stuff
rip ea ermor somehow made actually worse in dom 4
idk if it's worse. its just bad as always
i think it's worse
problem with tattoos is the spell is only aoe 5, and doesn't scale with paths
gladiators own though
the rec point thing and 2 turn out of forters are bad
ah yeah
i never leaned too hard on flamen
cause they suck
ok mainly the rec point thing tbh
they made the troops slightly better but even more impossible to mass
yes
swedes hate rome because they were never colonised
no tin can't grow grapes get fuck nords
my northern irish pals have a similar "pssht... rome..." inferiority complex which is okay but also pretty lol
tfw when you are one bog island away from the continent too far for rome to care

a lobby named üçÜ üí¶
good shit gonadic
.tag samog good bot
there we go.
!turns
so in the db that'd just be represented as the name `:wow`
i have a feature request, can the bot only count players who are not ai for this notification:
your turns:
silt-yomimod-game turn 21 (15h 10m): vanheim (submitted: ‚úì, 9/12)

why does winter disease my old lizards even though they're still in heat 2
look at those old lizard
damn
sad trombone . wav
sighedan.
scales patala strikes again
spahbeds?
more like
boing: because thats 1 heat colder than they're used to.
spahbads
jbrereton did you go full on scales?
5 spahbeds what the heck
yes as my absolutely owned capital due to a story event will attest
what story event?
i need all these patala details
if you are about to go scales patala my advice is : do not unless nobody else is bidding for mercs and you don't have very bad luck in some respects

tfw birnam wood attacks you at dunsinane hill.
<@!148098869782118401> fixed
turns now only counts human players
sweet
this f1s1 dude had his fuckin eyeglasses on
lmao jbrereton
what did you do
poor ragha
losing to scales patala as quadbless ragha requires ritual suicide
paper üëè rushes üëè scissors
apparently my reward for clearing out the bloodhenge that will literally always defeat about 7 nations' capital pd is 1d6 nature gems and the useless bow adventurer, lol
plus a chance at a constr 0-4 item
meanwhile in an actual misf3 province
did they buff stellar cascades? it's mr to resist half
and i swear it was mr to resist full
also since when are light lances one use only, ugh
it used to be not mr reist at all
oh ofc
does communion slave fatigue for multi path spells depend on the main path of the spell
yes
too bad for these augurs when i cast bane fire but oh well.
is cure disease a new spell? that seems like a good spell
it is new and quite bad
unless it is good? idk it seems bad
you fucked it up
.q mu
.q mu
oh. nice its not fuckedup
light lances are not one use
you just only get one charge
its thematically satisfying that in the act of casting the good shit, the elder augurs kill their lil bros
they can cast bane fire without communions cant they
!details bad

whos signed up for ryleh
someone made a mistake
conot
i think
a
and then signed up as someone else
but cannot remove the r'lyeh
<@173950598138298368> nothing exploded but can you destroy the ryleh signup for server 58
<@110869804197351424> there is one slot left in this badnations game for you
i thought it was full
its not full
the reason its full is osmeone is dumb
lol
lmao jsoh i assumed youd actually expanded beyond your cap circle somewhere
but i guess not
one in four augur elders can cast bane fire without a communion.
or a gem i guess
or a skull stick or power of the stars or whatever the fuck
boing why did you attack me
i want money
then you should have attacked jsoh
who was stuck to his cap circle
i dont border jsoh and i dont see his money provinces.
go attack scales patala imo
im not stuck in my cap circle because i own province 69
:)
nice
yeah which i gave to you because boing is bullying me
if boing no bully i could have killed you or man
now i have to fight an idiot hellwar with boing
which neither of us can actually win
im sorry to inform you that you could not have killed me
i win the war by holding this 100g province against your stupid small friendships
a war with me would also be a unending hellwar
jsoh i have more horses than you have comis
and twice as many provinces
do you really think that matters
yes
have you see the stat line on gladiator
???
i had a thousand gold at the start of this turn
if i was threatened i would have a hundred gladiators
and you would not kill me
ok not a hundred
lol if you have more than 171 income like a coward
but ~33
and then, 33 again
and then, 33 again
and then , 33 again
also im pretty confident in comitenses ability to beat 1.5x their number of knockoff eastern european horses
this bullshit
it is bullshit yes
the mod inspector is not flawless
`silt-yomimod-game turn 21 (13h 15m): fomoria (submitted: ‚úì, 9/11)`
never forget
[in chairman shenji yang, but only a bit, voice] not only can a light lance be used multiple times, it can repel too.
the game says the same thing
im gonna test it


the light lance is thrown away after charging.
maybe it actually throws away light lances for dudes who have another weapon
makes sense how the fuck are u gunna use a lance and a sword at the same time
yeah it doesn't on for example wind riders

trillwinter
aaaaaaaaaawgh
let me throw away this useless light lance
and grab my trust light lance
the singleuse one is used only by ermor equites and jomonese cavalry
how are u gunna use a light lance and a broad sword and a shield
the shield is strapped to your arm so you can hold the lance in one hand and the sword in the other
where does your shield go
boing is that for real about equites and jomons
on your arm
because lmao if illwinter devised of a way to spite those shit nations even more
its true
i am going to delete the shitty light lance in jbbm and give those guys the real ones
my quintuple ermor bless seems dumb no
no, it's good
it'll be good for lares.
do you actually thug those guys
sacred , ethereal, can buff prot and regen
and liquid body
any bless on ermor is worth it just for that hella sick hero you can get
lol if you dont take misf3 on every nation
do you mean the gladiatrix, <@97756994454188032>
etimmu
jbrereton balance mod?
yes jj
im the other ermor
rip
all of ermor died but their knights still got better lances
the gladiatrix ftw
what a great troll of the people who play ea ermor by the devs
?
they have a slave collared unsacred maiden of the moon ramc
as a hero
replacing the guy with 2 buds as the arena person
i love the idea of summoning a rural household spirit and kitting him out with murder items
like "oh there you are. no i don't want you to bless my crops, here take this mace of eruption and go fuck up some bird men"
hey if you think about it the citizen manipoles of ermor are, in the own way, rural household spirits sent to war with murder items
early age, but oldest men: ea ermor
its because they have healers and are therefore functionally immortal against the ravages of age and disease
try telling that to their 10 enc "elite" troops
its dumb to give the biggest spears to the oldest dudes but being old does not impair your ability to read a book or cast bane fires
its super illwinter though that old age rarely causes sight loss, dementia or heart problems, but definitely makes your limbs fall off every winter
hip replacements and that m8
falling over fainting after one too many sherries at christmas and smashing ur wrist up
not too much of a problem today, in the dominions of times, big deal
maybe in your sloth dominion
<@282646158218756116> still need help
did u delete the ryelh pretender
no
!details bad

not yet
can u please
theres no way for me to do that is there
!details bad

ty
and no
not yet
ma agartha is boring to play and should be avoided like the plague (because i want to play it, get away.  it's quite fun)  
they've got a reasonable if small toolbox to work with and the generally terrible movement does indeed suck.  on the flip side they get scrying right from the start so marching towards objectives at their crappy speed can at least be well informed.  still trying to work out a decent pretender design for them
sorry about that
didn't realize there was no water till after i slotted
well that changed actually
wtf
since the guy made the map robot play friendly with all ages
<@110869804197351424> join my game
im playing ars magica
well, i'd swap back to r'yleh but then naksu would have to delete bandar log
also trust <:trillwinter:372894192894214176> to not actually put in a way to unupload a pretender
a shameful partial

<@120675876043096066> you're last up with 3 hours to go
wtf is... arse magica
ur mum
:eyepop:
yeowza how rude
okay ermor that's enough capital for you
it's also hilarious that bot got dispelled immediately again
i do my best
does anyone have water gems they want to be other gems?
because i am finding 0 water sites
haha jesus fuck this game
i saw ragha lose a lot of very expensive sacreds, but i guess they can afford that in la
i genuinely have no idea what to do against national elephants that hit hard in la
you probably cant afford to lose very expensive sacreds if you have 3 dom and trash scales
they're only morale 8-10 but i can't actually get them to morale route
or if they do they just trample through my army defeating the point

press the "cast frighten" button
this is as jomon i assume
i tried casting agony a hundred times over
n, as marignon
try casting 50 imps and 50 agony
and lost your 164 gold province for 2 turns
sad!
but it seems even if they rout due to morale they go for the "nearest border" out of battle which is inevitably my side since they start at the very front of the enemies' line
so they just trample through my units
are you sure they aren't zerked or some shit
b/c you always rout toward syour own side
be glad that he is making elephants and not zhayedans
you can also cast bondsof fire and false fetters and stuff
unless they have invisible zerk or something, no
those are low rp spells but you kinda have to tech for them specifically
in this latest battle they got set on fire and shit and still just charged onward
actually no they are like alt1 and thaum2 they are easy as heck

what research do you have?
conj 5, evoc 3, constr 4, ench 2, blood 5
addendum: he's sitting on my capital and my only other fort is across the sea
and he wiped out most of my remaining mages in a recent break out attempt which went
well, look above
agony should have done it really
ok, what've you got left?
basically nothing in cap, a few mundane commanders and a single 1f 1s 1b mage, basically no units to speak of
cast bot and go ai
in my other fort i have like, 13 mages + priests + the ability to recruit sailing commanders, but no way to give the mages sailing
i do not have thaum 5 or death mages
i'd trade water for pearls
i'm a bit low on pearls
i would probably have walked around them and took their shit unless theyve got a lot more provinces and armies then you
thats 1700g in elephants
in a single army
does he have many commanders, do they have astral?
they had been kinda expansionist and it was probably a mistake to fight him head on but alas
4 commanders, only one  mage, no astral
i do not suspect he has a reserve of mind hunting mages twf
just a suspicion here
nop.  really just fishing here
marignon *does* get astral, but it's not a reserve i have, no
i've got nothing particularly useful for that cap mage
alas, my non-cap astral mages are 1a (1w1s)
can you mind hunt your own province
yes
without killing your own mages in your own cap
prepare to instantly blow up some random scout's head instead of the critical enemy mage
tbh i might just go ai
be brave
this game has kinda blown for ages, between the staling utgard and the ragha who sieged my province only to go ai
cast some imps + agony + bonds of fire
see it through.  you've still got a fort so you could script that mage to, um, summon will 'o the wisp?  try to blockage the fort breach
yeah you're probably going to lose.  see it through anyway üòÉ
whats yuor pretender
dead
rip
i think its this one
but i can't recall offhand and he's been dead for a while so
!details

summon 5 imps or 2 will 'o the wisps?
how's he dead?
he was set to patrol on the cap because i thought masscasting agony would fuck the elephants
it did not
hmmm
tbf im incredibly confused now
if that guy casts agony until he passes out
the elephants should rout even just from trying to hit him
did they start with like 30 elephants or something
going off of the sprite they look like war elephants #1555  
base mr 6, base morale 9
a guy with 200 hp and ethereal and fire shield should 100% not die to straight up elephants
also shoulda been h3 g3
maybe he died due to hp routing, if the elephants hit a bunch of chaff?
can it even move
i dont think it can
i want water gems, lots of
it cannot move no
and i have a lot of chaff that the elephants like to chew on, yes
<@120391130536738816> stay out of cliffport (74) please and thank you
<@184675842432040960> this is not a drill. mictlan is deploying vampries
which one is that
just to the north of the one you just took this turn
oh
aight
üëç
also i would like to trade for more d gems. 8w+4n for 10d?
again?
i need nature more than water
i gave you 8n last time
but, if you aren't just alchemizing, then of course i am willing to swap 1 for 1, n for d.
also im actually dead in lanights after some consideration
being on defense is piss when you have roughly equal armies
how do i make an army running around stand fucking still
<@178868273935417344> welcome to the dead in lanights club
i have 2 provinces on turn 10
i've only not gone ai so i can play the "how badly can i fuck the guy who tries to kill me" game
nice can i have ur stuff absum
box them in or teleport on top of them?
no jsoh
i dont mean im literally dead rn
i mean that i'm probably going to die a slow death
boing will bully and torture me while i slowsly bleed out
yea so give me your gems please
im not giving you my uuh 15 gems
theyre all going to the war effort
do you have any nature
i can give gold
no
firebirds have given me zero events so far
i went ai in my fire bird game because someone with units attacked me and i lost
rip
on it now
i do not understand how to play air nations honestly
its insanely annoying because you abysia and man were all still at cap circle
i had idk 14 provinces
and i get attacked
and you three all get left alone
im very annoyed
actually
man doesnt even have his cap circle
honestly
i was going to get left alone
still missing two provinces
man is almost in my cap circle actually
and also caelums
what
so i think ur scouting is incomplete
h just failed to expand in his cap circle
again
like ive seen him try twice now
lol
oh wait yea
i didnt pay attention
<@170392794706214912> i cannot spare death gems anymore. i will trade fire or, idk, just fire actually
this guy.
what can a marble oracle be used for? it's a commander with h2 and the usual agartha statue trimmings.  seems like a thug but i have no idea how to fit it
thinks i'm gonna trade my valuable nature gems for crappy ol fire gems.
every death gem is instrumental to me winning war of northern aggression
do you have any pearls at all
even a single pearl riidi
fire gems are extremely  valuable
i think my best option here to teleport in and cast retardation bolts at his mages
.tag virtual_russian ermor picker
i dont actusly know whether i have any pearls
ill trade death gems for pearls at our regular rate
otherwise i want 2:1. i fucked up by giving you waht i did.
well not 2:1 but oyu know what i mean
1.5:5
1
1
1
1
1
our "regular rate"
you want me to give you 12 pearls for 10 d gems
il ldo that
i guess i'll say this: you don't ask for too little.
that being said, dream fucking on. i'll swap you one for one, n gems for d, or w gems for f.
you dont want death gems
so why even bother asking
of course i want them
okay then i want 12 pearls for 10 death gems
thats more than fair
that is an insultingly terrible offer, you asshole.
what the fuck is the matter with you?
the matter is i am fighting every other player in the game at once while you sit around qqing about werewolves or something
you know everyone else i traded with this game got a ratio of 0:1 in my favor
you're not fighting mictlan. i know this because he's 100% in on me.
everyone in the game except vanheim is doing what mictlan says
all you gotta do
is take the trade
you were okay with it last turn but now its a big deal
well guess what i got ribcages to make and shadows to blast
ribs to cage
i was okay with it beacuse it was gems i have a lot of, not pearls, which i don't.
that's what trading is for. you each give something that the other needs more than you do.
what i need the most are pearls
what i need the second most are death gems, what i need the third most, is things i can turn into pearls
ill do 1:1 for pearls
its not like you use them anyways
fomoria is sending another retard blob at me. a hundred nemedian warriosr commanded by two mages and two generals. this is so stupid!!! why doesnt this guy attack someone who can't assassintae him!!
it will be okay, friend
i know it will, but its annoying, because im gonna have to spend like 10 nature gems and lose several hundreds of income.
wait what
fomoria is attacking you? fomoria is attacking me
i guess he has a lot of shit to throw away
heres how madwopr plays: he drives a slow moving army into your cap ring and just runs around until it dies
but yeah knowing he split his army just put fomoria #1 on my player murder list
what is agartha doing
fuck all
he's had an army parked on mictlan's border for 2 turns now and done nothing. i guess maybe he's building forts? who knows
u can see forts under construction
!details

jsoh, does fort level matter for therodos freespawn?
im absolutely going to lose my mind if buff mind controls madwopr, karp, and kieran into selling him blood slaves for gems
i should never have done any naps. its always a bad decision.
ok riidi lets figure this shit out
what is your plan for fighting mictlan (but winning)
i win by not fighting
he's got ~200 units stacked up in a woods fort but only 4 commanders, if he tries to advance i'll seduce
hes patrolling for you then
meanwhile i run around his backlnie with impunity. eventually he'll step into a trap and lose all of his commanders and then his blob is jsut a bunch of crappy chaff
cuz he found one of my black boys
obviously i'm not going to be moving into his forts to seduce, yes
ok what im going to do then
is hit fomoria really really hard
straight shot to their capitol
anyway i cant tell you too many of my strats because maybe you'll leak them to him in exchange for gems, *i* don't know.
i would but it would have to be a really good one to be worth gems
ive got 15 death gems this turn
ill give em all in exchange for 20 of runner's choice
or if you're using them to forge, i'll just send you the item
no atlanton
or at least not for commanders
which is all u care about mostly
fomoria is casting pale riders a bunch
which is a good spell, sure, but he's tricklnig them out
did you know, that, five turns ago, i had a big decisive battle against agartha and fomoria cast seeking arrow twice and killed nothing but my archbishop
so i lost 30 knights to not being so sacred now huh
he has been, and i wish i was making this up, casting seeking arrow to assist his allies
crazy. insane.
its terrible
anyway ill send you 20w
done
lol
what pd levels is "quite well organized"
>>mugsbaloney - yesterday at 8:51 am
would anyone be interested in writing up their pretender design /strats etc? id be interested to know what you guys did and what youd improve etc
i based my pretender choice on jokes
i wanted to be dippin' dots, the outsider or otherness or whatever is a bunch of floating balls
but went with an earth snake named black snake moan because r'lyeh is kind of garb and i needed expansion help
he solo'd most provinces in and around the lake til a bunch of cavemen kiled him
for r'lyeh, a nation i knew going in was not top-tier, my strategy was "be a less attractive option to attack than the next guy"
you don't have to be the fastest, you just have to be faster than the slowest
i went scales with an expander because r'yleh has nothing worth blessing and needs so much gold
6-19. hth.
@conotr
i set everything to 6 for just that reason
those caveman & their clubs can be surprising occassionally.  i think most targets seem to get chosen based more on proximity & diplomancy rather than value, except maybe ermor.  i saw i had a bunch of do not eat stuff and could do fun things with gems so i went death 3 with much the same idea of making it seem less valuable a target.  i might still take death for points but it just didn't seem meaningful enough as a deterent
death scales paint a target on your back if anything
also the supply mechanism doesn't seem that strong, given indie nature mages aren't uncommon
oh my aufcking edasjfdsa
if you want to run death as attrition you have to do a popkill nation pretty much
https://puu.sh/zbvlk/060f71108a.jpg
yeah it's not a fast rate
otherwise death just really seems like an all-in option for a bless
lmao
you are being dogpiled by all players and the game itself
its not even my misfortune
its someone elses dominoion
stygian skin can be nice and withering weapons seems to fairly reliably ensure that things hit die post battle
i lost
20 sacreds from that
looks like 5 years aging per battle turn then turning into damage once they're old
stygian is good iff you have magical weapons
or are fighting against undead
otherwise you buff the opponent just as hard
magic weapons ignore invuln though so if your national troops use magic weapons you're set
sorry i mean stygian rains
ah
"things die after battle" is great if it's hitting a 400g mage and less so if it's hitting a 30g mook
most of my sacred stuff hits really hard and tends to kill stuff outright so not sure it's that great for ma agartha.  maybe it works for some spells, sacred mages?
what, withering weapons?
did he get arrowed
nah
before your things instantly killed bogus and his friends
he got arrowed
but then the dark knight killed him
oh didn't he have guards
b.c my guys were still on hold
hold attack
no
badly positioned
rip
turn 25 of dogpile
raiding party destroying temples
like 2 turns of recruitment ust flying around wrecking shit
anyway i have a level 3 throne
and cataclysm starts in 5 turns
so i think i win
who the heck is spamming seeking arrows at me?
ulms the only other guy with a level 3 throne s
show yourself coward
so its down to who can defend it better
and also dice
stop injuring my shitty monkeys
i wish i had enough d to twiceborn my god to put some insurance on my bless
me too.  got sneaking suspicion it might be ai ys?
yep
how will you stop kurgi
condor is 8 mr
does hrurvur show up too
cause he's got shock res
they should add ars magica mode where every effect is resisted by mr but also nothing has mr
if you get scabiel you will kill him pretty hilariously at least
no fucking shock res. idiot dumbass bug horror just going to get stunned and die
its scabiel kurgi and uhh
another one i forget
i always forget
well how will you handle kurgi
i assume you have an antimagic caster
supays and huacas have lots of mr
do you have enough alt to battlefortune your stuff
if you mr and battle fortune you should be able to handle them all probably
hrurvur would hurt a bit but you should be able to kill him anyways
maybe put on lightning resist for that
he likes to spam shockwave at point blank with innate
agon
agon is the other
he has unsurroundable ten
aside from 25 defence, 20 fear and unsuroundable 10
hes easy
also dr2
oh shit
though that's nothing compared to dr7
still
you will already have antimagic up anyways for kurgi
im getting like
hopefully it's just scabiel
6-12 attacks a square
who you kill with losing like 0-10 guys
they have retinues of baby horrors too innit
hruvur has false horror friends
idk about cata i didn't play that much with it
why is dragon girl better than all of the pretender dragons
a2w3e1!
with e1 base you could actually make the idiot fuckers expand
army kind of shifts to being mostly supayas
since i cant cast spells anymore soon
supaya work better anyway
brave, more mr
supayas and skelemans/ghouls
brave, mor mr, magic weapon
magic weapon (bad)
still magic
but it will shock stun so it's fine
and pile on fatigue also
being stunned doesnt stop them from casting spells tho
i think ulm likely has a fort on their throne
whihc is bad for them
he has to patrol then
ya
where as i can reanimate/research/preach
are you two the only two with claimed thrones
no
jsut
the only with level 3
so you just have to hold
until the others are broken
yeah
well i have 4 points rn
so if i get lucky i win
perfect
and if i dont get lucky and i can hold i win
what is a weetabix
theres 12 thrones i dont hold and only 2 that i do
sceleria also has 4 points but theirs 111 and 2
err,  1 1 and 2
they have infinity skeletons tho
nuclear moneky did you see the big reveal of what sphinx thrones do
weetabix is a breakfast cereal
that's generous
its a pressed cereal cube
that dissolves into mush
we dont need your editorializing here
yum
what do
the big reveal is : sphinx throne defenders cast 3 self buffs and attack rear
with 80~ fatigue
excellent
what does the bad luck bless do
is it just a 2-turn curse
it seems v suspect on first blush
b/c you have to get hit
in other dominions games curse luck made you more likely to get crit / made you take slightly more damage
i kind of assumed it was 'double damage' like fools luck backlash
but never tested
what nations have high prot sacred chaff
the bad boys of bad luck
niefelheim
ghost havers
dont care if u kill their sacred chaff
living pillars have 21 prot
sure
!details bad

samog join my dang game ! join it! samog

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/372490951391838221/406973373030203403/lzigxzd.png
samog instead of ever making a nazca game make a everyone is uruk game
becasue uruk is so fucking stupid and b ad and confusing
the bad luck bless might be good for rus because of bears
but then you would ahve to have bad luck on firebird nation
uruk has like 5 commanders too many
uruk has too many units, and then they have 6 more for underwater
they lose the ability to recall a god with no penalty right
they just have elegist so it's easy
i dont think so
it's not in their thing
like it is for ur
uruk has
ten priest mages on land
and 2 more i think uw
i just kileld my god can called him back and he came back with the same paths and same domscore
maybe i should try this with someone with more than n1
i died 5 times and lost no domscore or paths
i guess they just forgot to put it on there
same
that fucking chariot
jeuss waht the fuck
is this heor
jesus christ illwinter
hero
200g for 19hp
14 prot
w4e3n2h3
i throw a bunch of shit and some unscripted mages at a throne as a hail mary and actually take it
inspiring researcher
i think the ai is better at scripting than i am lol
i think to play uruk you make your stupid fucker 16g bow
mm 12 lol
the other bow
that costs less res
blisteringly fast mm 14
ya
14 strength longbow tho
also your melee troops are ireedeemable trash so dont make them ever probably
o
galas are spell singers
yes
because ?
double the swarm!
well
you should probably make nineteen galas
s3 recruitables who are sacred
and a good as fuck god
and can random s4
yeah recup
all ur shits sacred actualy
so recuperation is a no brainer
recup, arcane finesse if you can get it probs
oh theres recruit anywhere s2 also
this nations not so bad
and the big ladies acn make coins
why do they need
they dont have any sn chassis
3 separate priest+ 1 path units
5 too many commanders
too much shit
is it possible to thug ensi
https://puu.sh/zby1r/74fcbe90e2.jpg
inspiring 2
4 paths
what the fuck
is this
dlc god
ensi can be thugged easy i think
his base combat scores are ass but he's got the other stats for it
yeah i saw that.  those mages did quite a lot, some of it even useful
(also goddamnit i wanted that throne üòõ )
it's too hard to get recup and finesse on the same dude
oh wait, dragon can do that i guess
idk if i want to take a great sage for rp bonus because thats what you do when you take a minor bless rainbow
or take something else and hope and pray for the stupid great sage hero
you do not. you take a big fuckoff god because you use him as a bludgeon the entire game
you take mis3 kiss the hero goodbye
yeah
all in on mind hunt, the god https://i.imgur.com/qiff133.png
ench2 then uhhh
alt4
alt5 if no one else can moak
cheaper on a bull
altho u lose the hands, and flying
mobility and berserk is a giant liability later
oh its actually not really cheaper
since n2
literally 2 points
actually, ench3 then alt5
3 points
astral shield at s4 plus you get a pen on it i think
hurts to have low domstrength with 600 gold temples
that dumbass 4 path pretender would be so good on almost anyone but uruk
you have preachers all over the fucking place
if you need to control dom you can
urmallhu gets 1 more scale
but then u have urmallhu instead of a dragon
urmallhu can't expand worth a shit
shedu costs exactly the same but then you ahve a shedu instead of adragon
ie: no hands
a dragon amybe the actual best pick fucked up
need something that can actually fight and not be a pieceo f shit like your nation
https://puu.sh/zbypj/63d9805b20.jpg
flame spirits too.
cold2 with 14 map move lol
fire arrows instead of no fire arrows
yeah hmm
i dont think scorpion can expand without hard skin
neutral magic
heat 3
24 prot
can buff with fire shield/regen etc
57 base hp 24 is not enough
unless you wait for ench2
ench2 he's probably okay if you stay away from cav?
ugh oyu can only get 5 longbows from cap on turn 1 without pro 1
and starting army only has 5
https://puu.sh/zbyzk/985a3bf175.jpg blind lol
poison breath actually owns wow
its a huge swathe
didnt they change how poison works now also
ya you always roll
even if your pr is greater than poison
thats the only change i think
poison sucks and nobody likes it. what should we do
_thinks real hard_
i died to 7 heavy cav
make ctis die to their own foul vapors
perfect ship it
i will sell this throne to whom'st'ever gives me 10 000 gold ducats
dragon works tho if you are careful
at ench2 he's very safe
wow enkidu shamans kind of own still
125 gold for n2e1
bad at books and str tho
still worth making
ya you just put a lab where you are going to put a fort
and crank 2 out while its building i think
your best research mage is a fucked up looking fish creature
that you need a fort for :(
iw that ma ur
is
ya
oh
samog
join
my
game
!details bad

samog won dominions like willus
alright a indie commander with 1 turn of longbows once ur cap circle is half celar
kulullu sage is the goofiest looking motherfucker
can expand
with prod 1
well at least once you are banished to the ocean for being so goddamn shitty you can have good rp
lol my dragon got bopped by a barbarian commander and lost a foot
but recuperated it instantly
... but i sleep on that pile of gold
yeah making your foot all better is good
since broken foot means you fly slow because ???
one problem
how tf do i get a lab underwater
make a ring for the dragon
only const2. very easy
theres mermans and shit everywehre
i guess
that sucks shit tho
yes but wouldn't you prefer to sleep on a throne of your own?
with ench3 and a ring the dragon can clear ocean no prob
that heroes fucking bonkers i want to take misfortune 2
just to roll for it
turmoil 2 msifortune 2 is acceptable
inspired research on a 9 path h3 hero very good
turmoil 2 mis2 is civil war unlocked
i thought it was turmoil 3
hmm.
oh well can sacrifice production 1 then
you would just get the immortal old man n3h2
all the cool kids have thrones and i have none üò¶  
actually tempting
this is all theorycraft anyway im almost certain to enver play this nation
monkey join the badnations game
no im in three games
oh i went ai in stupid robot
defeat me as powerful yomi
why
i hate blood and i hate my dumbass broken bless
and i hate my dumbass awful starting position
solar bug is pretty shit
the bless is just stupid
what bless does yomi have
doesnt matter
reinvig recuperation morale or some shit
he has a make a lot of temples bless
he has like 60 bandit archers
and all of his guys have fire resist
oh, which is broken
yeah
and cancels solar
that's pretty lame
i also went ai in uhhh, some other game i dont remember whihc one
so im only in 6 games now
oh yeah the one where i was rus
only 6
did you recall your god yet in yomi game i didn't look
i didnt get a single event for 5 turns in a row and am bankrupt
yeah
or are you just attacking me with not blessed shikome
ages ago
tbh it would work either way
shikome are silly
they are immune to plague which is fucked up
i want the inspiring ur guy on pythium
though i assume it doesn't add. just strongest takes precedence
yep
big pythium play: wish for the inspiriing 2 ur god
fucked up hat i wasnt allowed to just mind control bolivar and make him my new god, giving me thunder weapons
https://puu.sh/zbz92/4a2f6b9472.jpg next mictlan god
actually kitty god gets all of the same bless with 6 domscore kitty god op
are there any early self buffs that can help a pretender expand into cavalry more safely?
ironskin
personal quickness
personal regen
uhhh
mirror image is early i think
if you go drain 3 dont you start losing magic gems?
need bad luck for those i think
check the luck 1 bringer of fortune fortune teller
makes sense
yeah mirror image is alt2.  that does seem the best bet, cheers
mirror image wont really uhh
make oyu not die
it just gives you more chances to not die
oh right last turn on gems 4 golds
yeah it looks like it's just more degrees of brittle.  hope they don't roll too high on damage, hope they miss from mirror image.  entirely plusable for the first hit to knock out mirrow image and that's all she wrote.  how do you deal with cavalry?  
i've been putting everything far back so that i tend to deal with just the cavalry first
have an azi
have 35+ prot
instanttly attacak rear and kill all of the commanders
have 25+ defence
flight is ench2, hmm
when does badgame start?
when it gets a 12th player
or , more accuraetly, like an hour after so i can make a map and upload the map
i will buy your gems
how many n do you have

and upload it
for an hour
this pd was not prepared for this https://puu.sh/zc2gl/5ffa52da78.jpg
comitense are special ops
5 guys taking out pd like it ain't no thang
yeah except thats a fucking tarrasque not comintense
yeah but my guys prefer to be killed by the honourable humans over the smelly swap dragon
i mean going by performance#
that tarrasque is mainly there for moral support
look at that centurion, killing nearly 29% of the enemy army by himself.
the centurion is myprophet
and world famous as : the guy who finally defeated bogus
my god for bad nations is very bad
i should make a better one
but i dont think i will
https://puu.sh/zc35i/a2505c1453.png you have until the uploads finish
it would be insanely good if i could somehow automatically create dominions five maps server side on naksus thing the same way i make game servers but that would be kind of a lot of work probably for not much benifit to anyone but me, the guy with the insanely dog shit canadian isp
aint gonna happen
badgods for life
my god is good and i playtested bandar log and what i'm saying is i'm going to win badnations
this is not at all an empty bluff which will crumble the first time i have to fight an actual player
i playtested my god several times and i think i averaged about 4 provinces by end of the year so things are only gonna go up from there
i dont even remember what my god is

<@282646158218756116> i'll make u a map, who's in the game
!details bad

aaaaa
thats whos in the game yeah
ive been uploading a generic map for like an hour
on it
gotta disable some wip stuff still
surprised no water nations
not for lack of trying
i had no water nations
because the generic maps dont make water starts
and theres no all ages setting
i was gonna sign up as oceania
give myself 30 provinces kappa
in the therodos game
theres like 20 water provinces or something and im in a 10 province lake
so one other thing about this version
it incorporates the new water size control features
as in total water size or rough size of each lake/ocean?
currently uploading a .zip to my dropbox, but going to at least test it ingame before sharing the thing
though come to think of it, it'll explode for me because i don't have the allages mod you're using

by the indelicates aka "that girl who left the pippettes before they recorded anything"
and "some other people also"
uploading to snek now, all start locations confirmed correct and working
also just realized you let someone get away with bogarus
that nations seems not amazing, but not bad
la abysia is the most questionable probably
discounted blood thorn is uhhhh
is la abysia still stuck on mm1 heavy infantry?
because i think mm1 units (under old movement designations) only get decent with lots of roads to make them pseudo-mm2
and i don't have roads in yet
im guessing bad map is the one hey
got it in one
i've not
its good, the bands good too
cool ta
looking at it i think it's a p. interesting one

woah the bot works!
i was *going* to play r'yleh in badnations but then i was lied out of throwing the uttervast at people
#fakenews
good! that isn't in the spirit!
i could've taken a great white boar but that is not the point
nice i won the game
msm personal / master of disease, nice
jbrere does your opinion of uttervast change if you know that it can get afflictions
which tbh is hilarious
uttervast with a "limp"
it's okay to have an ethereal limp i think
i like oprah, but the president, foremost of the westerners tbh
s'alright! somewhat dresden dolls'y

goonspeed, gamer
im going to believe that you are not playing some dastardly trick on me
hmm
im very confused
should have used yomimod‚Ñ¢
oh ok nevermind
sort of defeats the point of bad nations game
i was like "why do i ahve s4 and not have an astral bless"
+1
but far caster doesnt show up for some reason
from pearl?
oh right
ya alongside arcane leadership which doesn't show up
great fkin work there iw
i mean i disagree with sloth 3 on yomi
but then again yomimod me is rolling in cash so
ü§∑
i have decided that for bad nations game
bakemono are alright
i will go with the actualyl good yomi pretender design
ive only one mountain in my cap circle tho so im instantly defeated
wait im wrong
theres 2
!!!!!
2 sounds like a reasonable amount
that's like 4 normal provs' worth of onis!
theres like 5 more within what would be my nominal zone of control
if i were not yomi
i think even being yomi, is this piss poor a field
that might be a win
holy shit i have death 3
what have i done
lmao what have you done
i took luck death instead of growth misfortune
oh my lord
hahahahahahahaha
well
maybe you'll get some extra d gems
maybe that was what it was for
i hate the me of 40 hours ago
even in normal games i find my expansion as yomi is p. gud
pillage you are self, that income isn't scales dependent
maintaining control is another question but
eh
ü§î can you pillage a 0 pop prov
<@255835336083636234> please make the robot send samog a message about 24 hours after the games turn so he can put in his turns at the right time
you wanna put a bangin donk on it.
!details bad

oh god i'm in a game with samog
fuck
no but getting to 0 pop is v diff', outside of ermor land
you can pillage ap rovince with 10 income
er 10 pop
hell yeah
you can but it is insanely hard to kill them that way and you will get 0 income until you do
however events based on pillaging so long as they are #pop0ok will work!
there are pillage events?
hmm
if i raid a indie province whats the chance they wll fight me
quick lets conspire against jsoh in here since he refuses to read game specific channels
ok it looks like indies never stop you from raiding them
but you also dont get very much gold
hmm
i guess you could raid a throne until it didnt have enough population to make enough supplies to feed its people
and they all starved
im so good at this game actually wow
ya it's like a more nation specific equivalent to bvcing a throne
why the fuck
there are pillage/raid events in yomi mod, i don't know if there's any in vanilla
im trying to pillage yomi
and its getting repelled
fucking game
i think if im going to pillage my capital on turn one i need to take a couple guys out of the army
otherwise i hit more than 100 unrest and i cant recruit mages
wouldn't yomi basically be a land full of onis and their feudal peasants
sounds pretty tough to pillage
agreed
also i see a grand total of 2 caves on the map
corbeau map gen doesn't seem to like caves much
i've seen maps with 0 tbh
i hope i get at least one of them :x
they're both a medium distance away so its no sure thing
but neither is on the other end of the world at least
i've not had a chance to look at the map
i fully anticipate to be surrounded by wastes and swamps
ok
i only have 1 waste
22 guys with pillager 1 lead by a guy with pilalger 3
but my cap is only connected to 4 provinces, while the next province over has 6 connections
:(
gives like 250 gold
and leaves you at ~58 unrest
move cap option when
so presumably you could pillage againe with a few less guys
but 23 guys gives 300 gold and leave you at 95
so i guess if i can expect to expand i should pillage with 23 guys
either way is much much better than 184 income
how does dom3mods look worse now
huh
can the bakemono with yaris expand
oh i guess they are undisciplined so they wont make a good square
yo demon priests have 14 magic resist wtf
bakemono fight alright
oh that reminds me
you know how for oni summoning purposes it says unrest is treated like turmoil scales
15/point
does that mean you can get more then 3 "turmoil" scales by pillaging
no
or are you maxed out if you already have 3 nat
ah well
i can't believe i fucked up this ea tc game possibly completely due to being ill and attacking like 9 provinces ineptly instead of 2 properly
hmm
so ermor has air water and blood
and earth
marv has blood/nature
bogarus is a girl with astral/death
fire/blood on gath
with order scales
the reason the caves are there is becasue of people who like caves i think
if you feel like patala didnt get enough caves complain at corbeau asking for more
lmao that rerolling the map until you have 3 nearby caves advice was taken semiseriously
the robot wont work good with this name for the channel i think
better
does patala need caves?
i've never had anyone ask about their start before, probably because no one plays patala
yomi likes caves too
though they don't *need* them
also there are 3 caves on the map
they're uncommon unless a start demands them, but they happen
and i don't think any of these nations are mandated to have caves nearby
there are a lot more mountains because a bunch of nations have nearby mountain tags
<@317410996169736204> that image is too small
how can we put samog 3 miles off the top border with an image that small

have you ever even played with samog
no but repeating things that were said in the thread is fun
the legend of samog
you are appropriating our culture
this is not a costume
don't think of it as culture appropriation
think of it as hostile dom spreading into your land making it turmoil 3 sloth 3 death 3 luck 3

natural selection 3 lookin good
lol. my dryad used a gem to cast enlarge instead of swarm in a seduction battle
who did she cast it on
is that star citizen
atlanton you have to script them
uh so does libluini want this game paused or what
yes it is star citizen
also crytek responded to star citizen's legal letter and crobberts is going to get fuckin owned lol
he posted in the thread saying he wanted a pause yeah
i forget who hosts this game
<@96715337440952320>
<@190292302785150976> libluini requested a "extension"/pause till saturday in the thread, just a head's up
!details

how to teleport spells that transport armies work? just the units under the mage's command?
so you can't teleport commanders unless they can cast it themselves (or you have that artifact)?
uh even with the artifact you on;y get the dudes you are commanding i think
the cool thing about the artifact is it means you can do it from not a lab
all my good mages  are shit commanders :<
there's a hat
and a whip sort of
they stack
or you can make random magic beings
or undeadf
or you could be r'lyeh and a lot of your dudes would already be magic beings
is how i did it the last time i wanted to teleport armies
it felt really appropriate to the an empire of two seperate vast oceans connected only by my teleportation rituals
although it honestly would have been easier at that point to just finish conquering the land in between
hiya sorry
i don't read the thread so ping me if stuff like that happens
that's a turn reset
ping me tomorrow if they want it paused again
<@96715337440952320> they said they wouldn't be back till saturday so
i guess you can decide which way to lean on that
huh okay hmmm
how do i pause a game
ü§∑
i guess ask <@173950598138298368>
<@173950598138298368> how do i pause a snek game
uh don't at naksu except for serious stuff, i can explain how snek works
okay
how
lemme look at the interface real quick to be sure i remember
but basically you change the timer
to a large number
and hit restart
or like stop and then start again
if a game is paused for 6 days it will die.
there‚Äôs no stop button so i assume it‚Äôs restart
cool
!details

did someone ask for a pause in stupidrobo?
no, in la nights
cool, i'm not in that one
!details

for week?
no fucking chance
i'll let him get a sub or i can do his turns but i'll tell him
another thing to know as patala: eventually you can spam meteors at everyone forever
ehh
there are better uses for your wizards but you could
you have 1 cap only 4 point commander that can definitely do meteors
and another cap only with a 25% chance
i have not got a meteor capable mage yet in la nights game
and it's turn what 11?
yeah i made only those cap slow dudes after year 1 in my patala game
they have like 10 paths plus randoms
they can fully search provs in several paths if you roll a good one
they're pretty cool
and you can give them a pile of ablative monkey communicants
more of a late game thing though
hm
wouldnt it work better to set it to zero hours
(there are really only 8 paths plus 1.1 randoms. still very good.)
so there isnt a timer
no
b/c he claimed to be set on saturday
sounds like its time to hyperaggro caelum
i think you mean "for hyperaggro caelum >: d"
(if that's who he is)
it is
ok cool because that's who i will be doing turns for if he does not say "i have got a ringer such as flavah in"
where's our paycap on professional dominions 5 substitutes.
hmm
!details

they changed incarnate blesses on currently dead immortal pretenders without saying anything
so they no longer work if you're reforming
makes sense tbh
question
does move-patrol patrol out scouts and unrest?
no
it should be renamed and i told them so in beta but there we go
bless these idiots.
it doesn‚Äôt?!
well blast it.

<@282646158218756116> what is the game port
i cant take my turn because im on laptop and its not written down anywhere
!list

30058
oh nice.
so what does it do
it letrs you fight in a dfeensive field battle that turn, rather than automatically moving into the fort
there's not really defensive advantage anymore for battle
does achashic record reveal magic sites
people keep saying it does, even though the description says not to
can someone please set iloveu ai in stupidrobot
@ridii those gems pushed me into wrath of god zone btw. thank u 4 ur support
why does ilu need to be ai
!details

also what nation is he
achashic record reveals graphs for the nation whos capital you cast it on cryle thats it
no sites
<@179427307386044416> i did script her. her first spell was a gem empowered enlarge despite being scripted to swarm
v powerful
cryle you can't @ me if you are going to misspell it
i mean
it puts you there and gives you orders to patrol
but the actual patrolling doesn't happen until next turn
it's mostly there so you can land outside a fort
despite the turn sequence implying otherwise
yup
hi
sorry $ridi
rename "new bad nations" to "nude mad nations"
rename ea machaka to ooh ahh machaka
no village was ever ruined by trade
are you going to send everyone in the game a dm that says "hi" in another feat of heroic diplomancy samog
cryle akashic knowledge is the site reveal one
also graphs
no
the colombian exchange would like a word
graph is record
site is knowledge
trading smallpox counts
further: akashic knowledge reveals hidden sites, scrying pool or whatever reveals not hidden sites
nations that are nude and man, i.e. pangaea, or nations that are mad about nudity?
*nude and mad
nude and mad is the only way to live
any interesting pretender epiphets this time
look at yomi
ill bash ur fukin head in m8, sovereign of sin, friend of sailors
legit
male seeking male, master of disease. nice
lord of wildlife also

foremost of the westerners
well duh she's the president
president of uranus
why are monkies not attacking the vicious skeleton interlopers by the way
you have broken my expectation of dominions
oh, the monkeys are weak, frightful creatures and i have a lot to lose by attacking with mages when i'm not confident in my army.
to be honest this is yet another game where i deeply regret not taking blood vengeance to fuck up enemy mages
according to the art of war, this admittance of weakness means he‚Äôs about to turbofuck some skeletons
üêí
jonjoe take turn
i will later
all of the provinces in my cap circle look very suspicious.
in bad? mine look yugely dangerous or completely not worth expanding into
like 50 horse tribe for a waste, twice
can i get 48 he pause on games
hr
i have 1 (one) easy one i think i will take üôè hopefully it does not have a wind master and 3 cloud mages

excuse is admitted to hospital
hmm that's okay excuse
what happen
get well soon monkee/ the kid or spouse or alternative important person
i got the flu, then it infected my tonsil which made an abscess that was obstructing breathing
i am in nazca game and lanights and stupidrobot
la nights is on hold for like a week
they sucked 3cc of green yellow shit out of my neck
having kids and getting sick from them owwwwwnnnns
<@132118617163563008>  i am not trying to be a jerk here i am just trying to make a game which is a first return for mu and boing for a very long time not flame out and i hope you can appreciate that
i am not going to wildly declare war on people although i promise i will try extremely hard to own anyone that does try and fight you
i did not know there was a strain of brain-eating flu
bone hurting flu
[3:00 pm] jsoh: are you going to send everyone in the game a dm that says "hi" in another feat of heroic diplomancy samog
thats probably the most powerful diplomantic technique that exists
lol
fucked up but true
the really casual neighbour meme
is three days better? because technically, i'm only gone from tuesday morning to friday evening
hello neighbour winky face
i'm sorry but i'm just not doing it, that turns into people saying "can we have 48 forever" pretty quickly and the game totally dying out
tired: send everyone a pm saying hi
as i said i reset the timer on this turn so you can find an alternative you'd like better if you prefer
wired: send each person individually a pm saying hi, [nation name]
well, can you do my turns? i remember there was some problem on brainwrinkle with passwords using numbers or something
its not even a joke.
high effort friendlies
its incredibly powerful that ive made a game that exists only in discord so no one can really escape diplomancy
there were non irc fuckers, but there can be no non discord fuckers because the game doesnt exist anywhere elese. amazing
lol
now im going to disengage from diplomacy entirely because you made fun of my strat.
i can do my turns, i hosted the game and i have a master password
im operating on such a high level that ive defeated an opponent on turn 2 with a joke
perfect! just remind me that this is one of my games when i'm back, and i'll give you free reign!
im going ai.
so what is the most powerful diplomancy then samog? open your eyes
i jungle at 3.
set to 48 hr timer at request of <@!169456837236621312>
just for this turn

did they ever make the map filters work right
samog please make a user role for everyone who plays dota so i can beg dozens of people to play dota with me at a time
jsoh have you heard of
the incredibly good game mode
ability draft
quick jb send me all his gems
when i played dota i would say hi all, in allchat, once everyone had joined the server. it was not as effective a diplomatic strategy in that game.

if questioned on it later just say you summoned a bunch of magical units and lost them in a big fight with yomi which left me crippled

^^ as close to salute as i could find
hey conor i finally officially killed you in more turns like uhhh last turn
wow that took forever
conot*
how did that take so long
i didn‚Äôt want to recruit more boulder throwers
i had like one province and no army when i went ai
in fact
i was in negative income and losing units to desertion
i was spending all my gold on
temples and labs and forts
fucked up
too busy building swanky labs to put a friend in the grave
i see what kind of person you are jj
just this turn i‚Äôm spending 1850 on a fort upgrade, 2 labs, and a temple
what ritual makes ur soup 2 tasty?      burden   of    thyme
what ritual makes you release a sick holiday single? illwinter
i will regret nothing
what ritual makes you kill yourself
all of them
babby animes cannot harm chad giants
virgin jomon, chad utgard
what bless did you go with on them giants
only two incarnate blesses awake
he went with the extreme quickness memes
quickness regen
gotta
go
fast
quickness and swiftness
imagine a giant fatiguing itself to death
forever
best stratagem
imagine 4 sacreds at the edge of a cliff
they kill a lot of shit before they hit their kill limit
so what you‚Äôre saying is
the enemy just needs to throw bodies at the giants
until they hit their kill limit
lots of them yes
and a line as wide as the battle field
well, 3 per 1 giant
i am reading books. soon i can counter "lot of troop"
giants will kill more than 3 normal things
i know
i‚Äôm just saying for width
‚Äúgirth‚Äù
like 10 apiece before they start dying
does jomon get skeleton access
oh no\
nuclear monkey says he will be able to counter huge piles of garbage
someone kill him
lol
huge piles of garbage is like, my only thing
jomon in a snse gets skeleton access jj
in that it is invariably killed and turned into skeletons
jomon has incredibly cool access to all the good late game tools like...
not having shields
late game shields aint shit
or doing anything right
jomon has "make dai oni" right
sorry i meant to type late age
skeleton access, easy
jomon needs to escape to the underwater
and acid storm forever
jomon has make dai oni yes
please do not advocate for anyone to cast spells that kill infinity garbage chaffs
shield are for virgins
my name is shieldsmasher58
real men use 2h axe that whack for 40 damage
the limb obliterating axe
obviously dual wield supremacy
im going to make forest trolls and cast quickening and regeneration on them
and make them fight your giants
or quad wield if applicable
they will die in a single powerful strike
quick jsoh, cast a good spell!
ah but if they don't monkee
think of the 2 hp they will get back before dying
he has make a bug
virgin armor and shielded heavy infantry, chad no prot dual wield sacreds
they will get four hp back since they have regen innately and ive cast more regen on them wow i mso good
get this jsoh
they actualy get
five hp back
make bug works better than trolls
due to their astounding 26 hit points
wouldn‚Äôt that be 6 hp
no
well, maybe
sure why not
with 2x regen its 6
the real question is
would 25 hp 20% regen be 5 or 6
5
answer is dead in a single blow
trolls are bad yeah
time 2 cast englard
ah, but what if i cast bark skin on them
then they‚Äôll die in a single blow
don't they have 10 prot already
who fuckin knows
40-10 = 30
not on their head
i killed ai agarthas god by sending 10 forest trolls to bust up the earth elementals he was leading
ya but if it's slashing you get a bonus on stuff that goes thru prot jj
and also bust him up
that too
agartha took good of underworld
they have 12 prot wow!
<@190292302785150976> can you set marv ai in stupidrobot please
7 basic prot
why decrepus
he is a chain staler
wow seems like these guys might just be game changers jsoh
is he
he said "i dont have time to play my turns" and then didnt play his last 2 turns
okay
fair
what is the name of this offender
i love you
"creator of the calender" is a great epithet
ilu please be filial
like i walked 10 footman into his provs and took 2 since he isnt taking turns :getin:
ilu
@ilu you have been accused of chain staling
oh
he‚Äôs not even here?
did i miss "jomon is bad" chat already
he vanished
<@!177843734656974848>
he does that
because yes, they bad
the robot offers all of the information you need
i dont think hes taken a turn in the past week
you cna search the channel, for chats by i love you
to confirm the thing i said
ai him and reset to 50hr
a shameful waste of a spot in an allstar game
discord is vastly powerful wow.
also has anyone seen the player grampybone bc lol
grampy bone is gandalf the purple
who is that
<@97756994454188032>
he is quite a talkative guy around these parts
my jomon plan is make aka-onis
i am not grampy bones
thats <@389252874242359296>
oh
jsoh wtf you idiot
fine whatever
and then maybe take provinces?  it is not a great plan
lmao
who the fuck are you then
never make oni
grampybones is both the worst and the best player i have ever faced in dominions the videogme
he means the guys who are called aka oni but aren't those
aka obi samurai not aka omni
^^
if you deploy aka oni and aka oni in a battle does the battle report count them as the same kind of unit
nah
if yomi got real gold income the strat would be ignore demons, recruit yari bandits, and make a shitton of mages
but they are better than my sacreds which are fit for the dumpster
samurai archers
just having a fuckin longbow is a solution to very many problems
yeah, archers and akas
nah
just archers
is there some upgrade longbows got in dom5
daiymos are decent with their +2 morale to 4 squads
longbows have more range
and also damage boosted by strength
so most everything that uses them does more damage than it used it
has anyone confirmed that archers now dont target the absolute most stupidest shit on the battlefield now
of course not
bc archers would be cool if you didnt need 200+ of them
if there was a guy with a longbow a kimono and a katana jomon would be way better
^
if there was a guy who was just fully nude and only had a longbow even better
it's their dumb fuck armor
the thing about jomon that makes it a terrible nation
9hp tho because he is from eastern pantokratia
basically every nation could be made better by adding a guy with a long bow and nothing else
is that shrimpmen are aquatic only
ya but jomon deserves it
when sharkmen aren't
street sharks should be cap recruitable
and it makes no sense
it should be the other way around
uruk would be actually good im certain
if they had a guy with a long bow
bow ronin and ronin
that didnt have 10 rsources of other garbage
counterpoint
ashdod have a longbow and are not good
he has armor
yeah their longbow is like fifty fuckin resources
armor is bad
someone do hinnom archer spam and re-enact the actual lore of them shooting people with their powerful bows
and lose to three vanhere
and then lose to abyssia
for lore
my proudest achievement in this game
47 fucking resources
worth it... worth it...
haha jomon have 9hp
yeah they are the worst
yes that should be removed
9hp jomon is dumb as hell
hey jsoh
10 or 11 the dudes are supposed to be elite
how close to ghost ship
jbbm v dom 5 will have not having 9hp jomons feature, it's powerful and under development
ive decided, very sadly, to not cast the boat on account of im going to make telkhines insetad
because i own almost the entire coast
oh ok
then ill fill the last two slots
yeah i killed hinnom but am now at a loss on how i can win this theodoros game
sad
cast vengeful waters
your jomon units should vary in hp depending on how much supply you have in the province
there was only one slot i thought
oh
instead of starving jomon units shrink 1hp per turn
sad
someone else already did anger water
i could theoretically cast burden of time
drought! rice crop fails 15% pop loss minus 1 hp forever to units recruited
but that would slow down my rp a lot
because thats nearly 7 ghost philosophers
how about this decrepus: to simulate the dishonour inherent in ravaging imperial lands with war, they start at 12 hp but have xp shapes that steadily reduce it, and their morale
and im running out of guys who i can safely not care if they get horror marked to read books
check this out: what if none of the stats changed but the sprites shifted hue slightly to be more yellow, and then also buck teeth are added in
i see you are a subscriber to /domg/ balance mod which does that but also gives them armour piercing katanas
everyone pick a nation and make a mod for it
so if i understand the throne of creation right, it increases caster level by +1 and reduces gem cost by 20 or 30
20%
but yeah
30% on conj
20% on construction
its fuckin bonkers m8
absum you are monkies in therodos right
throne of creating a war
wait did we really want supidrobot on 48hr timer or did we do that bc someone trolled jonjoe
yes jsoh
it is turn 18
why have you not cultivated the sage province
it‚Äôs turn 48 for only this turn
to make sages
oh ok
because i have no money
bc monkee ate a tide pos
pod
seems like you should have spent money on making sages instead of making naked awe idiots with a shitty bless
nah
<@96715337440952320> don't forget to kill the mammoth
i didnt look at my gold for like 3 turns and then i looked at it this turn and it was two thousand
because i took lots and lots of land
maybe mammoths, if more than one is left
are you at war with anyone
crucial question here
how do you not look at your gold
nope. total peace everywhere
rocky b subbing into the game by destroying the game intentionally is relaly bad i dont like it
i had lots of shit to script alright jonjoe
and i didnt expect ot have gold
because im a popkill nation with hell scales
what nation are you
if there was  a diplomacy victory, i would have already won
in the game im going to play theodoros, which i hosted
ah
jsoh i have a billion yogis or w/e but i cant be arsed to move anything anywhere
therados is a popkill nation?
lol jonjoe
have you never loaded them up
i haven‚Äôt even touched them
uw popkill
sad
they freespawn ghosts
exactly as cancerous as out sounds
and ghost philosophers
and have forge master dorfs in their capital
and also big water nature mages
with awe
let me guess
they never afford mages after year 1
how does therodos fight an enemy who uses water elelemtals
and then in every uw province they get other nature+awe mages
and they also get those in every coastal province
but they also get , forge bonus guys in coastal provinces
coastal forts*
so i get 2 gem lanterns and quils
wtf
fighting someone who uses water elementals would be disasterous
this keeps happening for some reason
but to be honest
how many rp a turn do you have absum
i was planning to attack one of my neighbors sometime soon
ish
<@181529528307417090> hell you can just walk to them with 10g deep one spears eliminating them instantly
tbf deep one spears are bullshit
wtf is deep ones spear
let atlantis have their one good thing ok
in the game i won as therodos i deftly defeated the evil ea atlantis
they are 6 attacks per square decrepus
uuh i was moving everything out of my cap to suicide at yomi but if i put those on research again its 1273
magic spear is the important part
the spear is also a magic spear of ghost slaying
nice i have more rp than u
im great
without them its 665
im gaming .
why does yomi have , luck as its only bless
fleur bleu ....
why does yomi
exist
their strat for the early game was legit "mass dai oni"
and it defeated me because they got lots of fire haver onis due to it
and fire haver onis obliterate ghosts
i dont know why anyone else didnt kill them
ok
the most powerful strategy in the game: never getting punished
well it will be interesting to see who you attacked by the time you get back i guess
agreed. diplomacy
then fleur bleu disappeared with like a thousand gems and four thousand gold
and rocky b agreed to substitite for them
and gave away all of the gems and gold and deleted all of the forts
and just started walking at people
also sloppymilkshake disappeared too
sloppymilkshake vanished off the face of the planet
i hope he is okay
and also since he left sauromatia has been harrying my poor abysians
<@384829121290829824> do got sick after starting up bob's mods. coincidence? i think not
atlantis has been confirmed for living pillar strategem. time to prepare the bug spell
hi i've never played mp games so i accept that i am the worst.
ma agartha gets shard guardians with magic weapons so stygian rain is valid
i'd look into a quickness bless at very least to bolster their shoddy attack/defense
hello friend
you are not the worst
i am by far the worst

hey are any games for thin skinned idiots starting soon
teh
why would they make a game just for me?
so now that me and jotunheim are officially at war, i believe every power in the game is at war?
the end is nigh!!! <:burn:372895357962682380>
the badnations game just started riidi
why was this game not posted on bran wrinkle
turn submitted for the mighty nation of jomon
<@153656281448710145> i like that it really reminds me heroes of might and magic 3 for some reason
probably the mountains
the game wasnt posted to brain wrinkle because i dont want to fucking do the stupid dogshit idiot math to figure out what every person is
brainwrinkle is not useful anymore
whats the monthly forge + monthly ritual spell again

it basically just casts wrathful skies in your favor right?

i need to play a game with people who don't all also play several other games with each other and chat all the time on ventrilo
play with the autistic retreads in here then no one does voice chat
we did once
the night the game launched
ew
i won the game
100% voice chat win rate gamer here
everybody change caps right now!
well damn, i managed to finally kill ermor's pretender
<@170392794706214912> did you take your turn
cuz im switched to unfinished
i have not yet, because i am still at my parents house
tell your mom i said hi
tell your wife and mom i said hi.
jesus.
is the ma arco commnder "mounted commander" just a generic unit
check the inspector
ohmy god its true
its all true
also arco gets half priced labs. im gonna be them in my next game
why
unless you are trying to lose within 2 years in which case carry on
losing owns, its how you maximize your games
just go for imprisoned hellscales and watch as all your neighbours agree to peace in our time
losing owns, its how you maximize your gains
i'm still around
after clowning tien'chi's 300+ man sieging force
learn 2 storm caps bro
if you take arco get finesse
nuclear monkey what are your top 3 nations
like power wise?
just your fav. 3
idk i like dumb bullshit that varies
whatever gimmick i want to do
i want to play ea rlyeh, mekone and bandar log
a win with ea r'leyh is the impossible dream but
for power, ea pan, ma pan and ea van
the androdai
i think it is their only path to victory
fuck to androdai
burden on ~15
would going blood on bandar log and pretending you are lanka have a shot
it is the only way
monkey magic bless
whys there no blood+fire demonic familiar bless
that gives a imp familiar to every sacred commander , for rp bonus
knowledge surge b4 inspire 2 imp familiar
you should be able to get extra bless points by accepting a random negative bless
and if you take luck its less bad
negative bless: u never recruit your sacreds
bam
wild magic bless would be cool
healing weapons, your weapons heal enemies
like s6, selects a random incarnate
any random incarnate
on a per cast of blessing basis
oh this time your guys explode when they die
pity
thats a good bless!
holy shit yeah!
yeah random on each time you bless
oh no now all of your blood mages are blessed and are on fire
today you blow up, tomorrow, quickness
random bless: oh you got...undead regen....
so all of your slaves have died
sounds super good
could even random on a power unit basis
just pure chaos
bless that requires order 3 and 9 fire: all your sacreds make the enemy explode on death
nuclear monkey would you ever play ea r'leyh if you could not cast this burden of time
whos interested in hell nations ea pan ma pan ea van asphodel sceleria ermor lemuria la ryleh hmm i cant tihnk of 4 more
helhams, ?? ??? ???
that would be...wild
is mictlan still a hell nation
that sounds like it would be very unfun very fast
xibalba i guess
nazca fits in with some but not all
la ulm
la ulm can't rush
maybe ma ulm. maybe'
oh is the definition of a hell nation a rush nation
i thought it was a nation that was completely shit to fight against
who knows, new frontiers of science
given the list he's got started, i'd say it's all turbo-bless hellfuckers
oh no
scelaria and lemuria
yeah, la ulm fits then
lemuria is a turbo bless hellfucker
a pan, ma pan, ea van, asphodel, sceleria, ma ermor, lemuria, la ryleh, helheim, xibalba, la ulm, ragha
is ragha still op?
<@184675842432040960> finished my turn fix
now i gotta shiyt
do your turns on the toilet
signs point towards yes
nazca is certainly stronger than sceleria
need a good yutub for caating wrath of god
nazca stronger than la ulm too
i'm ne, o i'm working on it!
is there a la nazca or are they ragha now
quickness is interesting.  does it also allow ranged units to fire twice as fast? 
having a lot of success in other games with ma agartha and minor stat boosts, on a site searching utility pretender
never blind-storm a cap
and try to bring -some- magic when you do it
ea pan, ma pan, ea van, asphodel, nazca, ma ermor, lemuria, la ryleh, helheim, xibalba, ragha, (mictlan? ma ctis? tnn?)
theres no ea or la nazca

i guess that's 11-14 nations. of which 70-90% are terrifying
at least ocean herpes is visually distinct
i really like the icebergs
i dunno if you can do something like large ice floes or glaciers but that would be neat too
imo now you add some penguins
has anybody actually cast seas of ice in dom5?
penguins also good add üêß
it'd look better with fewer, bigger bergs

no <@233383745779007499> i would not
ea rlyeh is not a functional nation
superbly broken in its inability to actually win a game
https://puu.sh/zcbmv/e9a7e6d8d2.jpg im cummmmmiiinng
it exists to troll unless you are playing with mods
erythreia...bad?
i mean
i ahd a quarter as many mages as he has troops
does it still auto-lose against the other uw nations? or does it stand a chance against atlantis/theodoros
what did the eighty five n1s fo
morale support mostly
they could have sat at home and read books
vine arrow?
ya
varrow can be p. okay
pyth storm pig thorns hell yeah
tbf 85 entangles every other round is p deece
i expected to lsoe that battle
so i cast solar brilliance
!spell vine
<@304750755397500929>: https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/?page=spell&spellq=vine&showmodcmds=1&showmoddinginfo=1&showids=1
so now most of my mages are blind
whoops
doesn't matter
guess it's just hitting the books and summoning elementals from now on
(why doesn't blind include an rp penalty?)
now herne is 8991 years old
sooth blind eagle eyes vine arrow is still fine
poor herne
i think i want to kil lmy prophet so i can prohpet the terrasque
yes
prophet daughter of python
how much map move does that have btw
what is herne's name?
herne
that doesn't show up in the inspector
lord of the hunt
oh no wait, i typoed
holy fuck, does the tarrasque actually have 5mm? did trillwinter fuck up somehow or is it the inspector?
no that sounds right
thats its dom4 mm
probably not actually
is daughter of python slow as shit
tarrasque has 8 mm
idk
i dont have a single d2
1mm powerful
fucked up
how is that possible
tarrasque will ahve mm 10 once i gift of reason it
still 1mm
ive kind of had to spend most of my gems on not dying for the past 20 turns
i hope herne dies of old age somehow soon so i can cast haunted forest
lol
https://puu.sh/zcc99/4d0a730dcf.jpg
a good game
can he i doubt it if he's thousands of yrs into old
im pretty sure you dont die of old age in battle
and he only exists in battle
he rolls new afflictions every turn
he can rack up enough penalties to finally die in combat, but i think he can;t get afflictions from it
sure yeah
somebody has to fuckin show up who can kill him
if he has disease it should lose up on age
hes just been clowning on chumps in a hyperbolic time chamber
lol
hey who runs treebot in irc
he hasnt had a disease yet
ornedan
jesus christ the victory setting is
18 points to win
out of 26
classic burnt corn muffin
make a game with insane win conditions and then dont play in it
haha
place your bets
the only winning move...
a blind centurion-prophet and 4 blind comitenses
vs a villians event
the could win
prophet smite
i mean
how many villains? less than 20 the legionairres win easily
if i left him in his gear as the guy who beat bogus
he would win for sure
but i want him dead
i dont know i was not in a position to have 1 point of pd in that province when the event fired
so attack close no smite. rip
scout report says about 10
at some point i will thug something to kill the lord of the hunt
are you sure
just so i can claim a shitty thug
hes fucking
over nine thousand years old next turn
such power
screenshot his afflictions
why
they changed every turn
lol
lol what
he doesnt exist except in combat
buggiest fucking thing
so , every turn he shows up, the game notices hse five thousand years older than old age
and gives him some affilction rolls for it
he will never die then
just get older and more fucked up forever
i guess he's probably coded to recver from afflictions so that the global has some teeth to it
but they didn't think about him getting decay'd
hes not getting decayed
he jsut ages 300-500 years a turn
its not unique to that game its a bug that exists for some reason now
lol
herne the ancient.
herne, he who begs for death
i wonder if wishing for herne would be worth it if he just spontaneously recuperates all afflictions. or is it from the global?
certainly he wouldnt act the same if he was a unit that exists on the map
also he would probably leave if anyone cast the wild hunt which would be embarassing
in another game someone had their elemental king die
and when they resummoning him he was way old
resummoned*
wold hunt is weird tho
i confrimed its wild hunt since the furies dont act thusly
apparently no afflictions stock just age
they get a randomly generated age within their age range and stay at that age
but herne and only herne, not his dog friends who i assume are not even the same guy every time
with kings afflictions can stick too. you hwy heal checks
get old as shit forever
is tarrasque unique
or can i have a horde of tarrasques lead by the daughter of typon
nice its not
how many tarrasques you think i need to keep my cap circle clear of fucker idiot fishmans forever
20
thats uhh
doable
how many provs? 6?
like 8
they have 18 mr lmao
tarrasque is not unique
yeah
he's also bad
as is daughter of typhoons
he just sits there and farts a lot until things route
tarassque has dragon gas hey
confirmed good unit
and eats an mr die
or charm spell
18 is p. good for a not-commander. too bad about ai targeting by hp density
well
i dont really have anything else to do in this game
so im going to make as many tarrasques as i can
and have them fart as much as possible
why not worms
the traitorous lemuria player wont give me 40 death gems and a skull staff
i dont have worms
is silt in the game
also im stupid
no
i should certainly worms
rip
idiort
im down to only a thousand rp now
since i lost 35 mages
sad
though i will say that conj9  has several good spells while thaum8 has only 1
compare 9s to 9s plz
the big difference between conj9 and thaum 8 is i have conj9 already
and id ont have thaum 8
tarrasque crew gogo
conj 8 also strong, but not as strong as 9. thaum 9 for meme builds and communions only
https://puu.sh/zcdpx/465c181294.png im so good at diplomancy
greenstone...
what
bogus's armor
hashtag kawaii
if you remove bogus's armor he gets an upgrade to full plate
green stone is trash
he didnt in this case
he got upgraded to a corpse
sad
didn't get to charm
daughter of typhon is not a commander is she
so i will gift of reason her instead of the tarrasque
prophet her and give her precious
adn she will lead thge tarrasque crew
no, for unknowable reasons
sounds strong
name her susan
precious sand whay
some mr i guess
a unique hydra immortal that is a) summoned as a unit not a commander and b) only has two misc slots
shameful
why would a hydra be a commander
gotta think man.
woudl you listen to a hydra
could be noleader
yes
i would listen to a 27 headed asshole probably
but still very shameful that they didn't give her a crown slot
the ultimate management hell
do units hiding in forts not show up in scouting rpeorts?
hiding probably not
any thing else yes
unless they are glamoured
they do not. hide is invisible on strat map
has to have hide order tho. our glamour
or sneak
i just got nailed by a stack of 50 eagle warriors that were not there last turn
did they move from further away
or teleport
theres also the item that makes a army look real small
did they use the bug
the bugs supposed to be fixed
what bug
gossamer cloth, ma mictlan would be able to forge it easily
is it
its ea mictlan, and they dont have any small-making item
fix for multimove out of besieged castle
could have gatewayed in
is in the patch notes
they were not there last turn, and this turn they patrolled out 6 of my guys
oh. move and patrol
what commander?
its an order
i literally asked in this channel if move and patrol did that
and multiple people said no
things on move patrol orders will join in on battles
even if they didnt actually do the patrolling
also, multiple people could just have been wrong
everyone is very stupid
and illwinter changes things without telling people
the vast majority of us are very bad at this game
they definitely did the patrolling, you don't find a black hawk with 15 points of province defense unless you also patrol with 50 eagle warriors
yes. in dom 4 they didn't actually de stealth
but who the hell knows now
if i give my god a shademail will he be able t ohide from horrors
yes
nice
like do dhorrors not assassinate people who are hiding is what i mean
oh
idk
eater of gods will probably find you
well hes got 0 marks rn
i'm gonna say test it
but the party starts soon
and has a tendancy to mark the thing you need to not be marked, and then murder them
tbh, if you just don't ~do~ anything with your god... he won't get marks
oh i guess i cna just twiceborn him if i have the research for it
nope
wrongo
catacylsm marks everything
oh that party
i thought you meant ac
god damn that pisses me off

a patch dropped
```dominions 5.12
30 january    - johan
this update fixes a problem where battle reports could get mixed up and attach to the wrong message. there are also a few new things like more heroes and random events as well as a bunch of other bug fixes.

general
battles could overwrite previous battles resulting in confusing reports
new heroes (members of the third tier)
new divine epithets
new random events
end turn warning also on expiring mercs and empty research queue
quickness was too quick when attacking
global message for theft of the sun
new prophet proclamation message
more popups
don't show inspirational icon for non-commanders
don't show spell singer icon for non-spellcasters
lower combat speed in swamps
rearmost target more reliable (but still not perfectly reliable)
fields of the dead was only half working
it was possible to target rearmost with hold and fire
fix for text highlighting in commander tokens
small delay before firing missile weapons
improved early movement anticipation for ranged units
innate casters no longer cast spells after battle has ended
far caster blessing works properly now
the last killing poison damage (green numbers) was not show in battle, fixed
fix for load/save with many maps in map editor
unique titles for disciples as well
mekone can cast sow dragon teeth too
event fixes
stat fixes
typos fixed

modding
fix for #divineins```
```
end turn warning also on expiring mercs and empty research queue``` noice
i do sometimes forget my research, especially
```it was possible to target rearmost with hold and fire``` oh hey that was a real thing
rip blink spam
is this a ping naksu situation
i know there are ~rules~ about pinging naksu so i want to check first
stat fixes
why did they make attack rear better again
these people are animals
<@184675842432040960> the worst part is that you know people are going to send him gold and say 'hope this helps with the dispel!!!'
no fix to insanely geriatric herne
no listed fix to prophets being blessed in enemy dominin
has this crashed every server again
yes]
it will when i try to do my turn
also they broke olms
they dont shoot anymore
im going to check this because what would even cause that lmao
they divide by zero when trying to lead shots i bet
yeah itll be something to do ith the new prediction
also the bot shouldn't be completely broken whenever any server is down now
so when a server gets back up you should be able to details and get notifications for it
and turns should show the ones that are up
lmao if someone is trying to break siege with  bunch of olms this turn
:thats_dominions:
uh
just started a game and they work fine?
<@303193134026981389> whatchu talkin about
ya wtf
i will look into that - was trying out ea in singleplayer but that's on hold now that they broke shooting
didn't work for me twice
ok explain the circumstances
in an old pre patch game and also when i just created a new one
well it just worked for me so what's the specific circumstances
new battle was 6 olms at back of field with fire closest
in a cave
ok but like do they have a particularly special bless or anything, what os are you on
what is it against
3rd time - windows, indies, precision reinvig bless, fireclosest, default positioning
olms just sit there but i did see them do life drain in the first attempt when the enemy ran me over
thats weird because i am also on windows and it works honestly completely fine and i have no idea whats up
send the turn save to iw
sure, how do?
i cant see the turn folder
saved games
next to your mod directory
whats the path? ive only got commonredist data maps
that's the wrong directory
%appdata% right
this is you / appdata / roaming / dominions 5 /
or just use the "open user data" option in tools
from ingame
and then savedgames
maybe its the precision bless but you didnt actually bless them right
100 precision
they dont care about bless
why would it be the prec bless
if 100 prec overflows it breaks maybe
they go from 107 accuracy to 114 accuracy
it would always overflow
because 100 precision is on the attack not the unit
ya
what else would it be
replay bug, some weird thing else, who knows
spaghetti code relating to division, replay bug, improper patch, one of a thousand things really
ü§∑
i got owned by the replay bug in mekone game
my god destroyed some stupid giants in the battle
but the report said he died.

why does samogbot ping me multiple times per turn
i feel like it happens very often
works a charm for me
<@190292302785150976> i believe it does so if it gets rebooted/crashes and when it comes back up it still sees an unsubmitted turn
<@255835336083636234> could probably do with a read indicator or something? i've noticed the same issue
does it crash every day
i know about it, i'm not sure what causes it. it is about crashing. yes it crashes every 6 hours or so
a recent example
did you do your turn? it should not message you if you've submitted
hurry up and take your turn idiot
i can't take my turn at work!!
or at 5 am while i'm asleep!!
okay, still crashing every day
it pings me once
and nothing after
even if i wait 12 hours
huh
sounds like you all suck
no fucking idea
let me finish lobbies and i'll look into the crash
everything works perfect for me ur doing great mate
yes if you submit its fine, but multiple pings per turn are semi-standard for me since i tend to take a few hours to do turns if i'm at work
üëç
i've had multiple pings too
having the robot mercilessly troll everyone but me seems like a feature more than a bug
i was about to check how many turns i currently had outstanding then i remembered all the servers are ded lol
all the servers are dead? snek crashes?
nah, patch
<@303193134026981389> the solution is to order fire x , where x is anything but closest
oh is it a quick bug fix?
mostly bug fixes, some notable changes tho
no , its a quick "break everything" patch
also regarding lobbies: how often are game started when the lobby hasn't filled?
started like, in play
<@282646158218756116> isn't that every patch
?
i presume he's asking how often games start with less then their pre-determined max
yes
or started like a server made and people begin uploading
i.e. 12 man game starting with 9
idk not very often
i can either error and stop it starting, or just warn and potentially fuck things up if the game shouldn't have started yet
personally im pretty stubborn about getting a full game
most of the recent games i've seen have started full
how are you going to stop it starting
but i dunno if thats just because post-christmas there are lots of players
the games shiny and new thats probably a big factor
assuming these changes are all real and not a disguised troll by illwinter, this is an extremely pro patch
well, jon joe
they didnt fix the thing where nobody in ma man can cast spells unless they are part of the club
to bad so sad
and they also made fire closest result in archers st anding still until someone gets into melee with them
hahah what
they are trolling us!
but at least now theres a way to have a big pile of guys guard commanders!
probably broke something trying to fix hold & fire rearmost
also the fact that that was actually a thing
hmm i wonder what mixed squads look like
makes me want to test whether the "undisciplined guys being able to guard commander" thing i found actually works or is just ui ambiguity
can you have an entire block of pikes guard one spot forever because of 1 archer
haha
wait is that why my fucking wise man didn't cast flaming arrows
yes
because ma man non-spellsingers literally can't cast
because he couldn't cast at all maybe
fuck _off_
very sad only archers are insntantly permanently paralyzed
<:trillwinter:372894192894214176>
actually wtf
they have absolutely knocked it out the park with their spell singer communion
<@282646158218756116> don't be mean even archers can have performance anxiety
jsoh on the other hand
i'm ai in that game anyway because ermor and indy events too all my lands
that would work for javelins
instead of using the commanion mod from dom 4
once my pale ones who were sharing a squad with olms got into melee
the olms charged
sickkkk
no jon joe
they dont fire
oh
they stand there until something gets into melee
and then they punch
oh
finally a way to do reactive white centaur strikes
does pan have any unit that doesnt have a ranged weapon and also isnt undsiciplined
centaur cataphracts
ea
?
sec
harpies maybe
i think one of their centaur units maybe
nah the boys have long bows girls have short bows
minotaurs i guess
centaur warrior jsoh
really i thought he has a longbow
there's centaurs and centaur warriors
ah
also satyr warriors in ea no?
maybe
not really important
idk i think i would be looking for the slowest thing
so the enemy would be a bit tired out + used its lances etc.
yeah so you recruit a single militia a turn
and the militia dies and is replaced from whatever is the new province version of militia
indie heavy inf in double line to be very slow
is there really a big problem with having white centaurs get into combat too early
this offers perfect defense against flying based rear attacks i guess
at least johan is asking questions in the bug report thread for 5.12 so he knows some shits broke and hopefully will fix it quickly :illwinter:
fuck you discord
<:trillwinter:372894192894214176>
whys it trillwinter and not illwinter i feel attacked
jsoh you literally own the discord
fix it if it bothers you lmao
while you're at it tick back on external emoji thx
jsoh no i am mainly being fatuous
the emoji are under samogs sway
i have no power here
which samog
there are 3 samogs
botsamog, oldsamog and ghostsamog
<@!399327311427665931>
thats botsamog
oldbotsamog, actually
yeah
its dead
rip
theres also <@&372528101076500482> the role but i dont think you guys are allowed to use that
<@&372528101076500482>
yeah i can
messed up
i half wonder if you remembered to remove `@everyone` from randoms but i daren't test it
its off by default i think
after some crimes done by other anime posters i think it was turned off
really ?
i dont rmember anything
it's on by default
its so good that icannot search the audit log for things ive done
only, anyone else
owner is above reprieve
when it was an embryonic kaaba channel we worked out how to do this
also shame on other anime posters for using @e for that
i sincerely believe this neve rhappened and j breretons brain is malfunctioning from all of the deep fried pizza molecules
it's fine, northeners have an attained immunity
they train themselves on deep fried mars bars
i cant find any @ everyone
unlike the deep fried mars bar, the pizza crunch is intensely real and not for tourists
and the only animes are me and conot afaik???
maybe fleur counts
jonjoe counts
even if he denies it
cryle, fleur, there animes
cryle is a homestuck
cryle is a webcomic
it doesn't count
thats an anime
same for demiurge
ok i found it
i turned off @ everyone for everyone on december 17
an auspicious date
wait thats not true i think
i cant read dates
.q add jsoh i cant read dates
probably the 12th of quincember m8
nope it was the 17th of december , 17
but yes it was on and we turned it off
figured it would have happened earlier
but i guess there wasnt really anyone here before release
oh
samog @everyone for blitz tag
uh
did you turn it back on
that didn't ping
no
it's fine
ok
and then some bozo @everyone to say he wanted the tag
you can tell it doesn't ping because it won't highlight even if you're the sender
it's good for that not to work
i think its disabled for the role "everyone" and not all of the ones created before it was disabled for everyone
so what you're saying is that crimsonwolf could @everyone
.q add conot does @everyone work if the bot does it
awww
no thats not how it works
anyone can @ blitz
or @ 2001
right, pinging is
nobody can @ everyone except probably me
<@&389927677416701952>  hey im an idiot whose pinging this
i want to say an inviolable rig- wow
<@&389931813528797184> sup
did that work
it highlighted ya
i dunno i'm not a mall cop

please stop flailing around trying to troll people with the robots
sorry i do qa testing irl, its part of my soul to try and break things
theres not relaly any reason for the robot to allow characters like @ in game names or anything
```
jsoh - today at 15:16
please stop flailing around trying to troll people with the robots```
but how will we continue
the epic ak tell tradition
hmm, what happens if ia make a channel that no one but me can type in that only conot can see and ping  @ everyone in it every thirty seconds
black mirror season 4 lookin good
i saw the edit
rekt idiot
dang
<@282646158218756116> pings only ping for people who can read a channel
yeah thats why i said "only conot can see"
i.e. if you had a mall cop channel only for mall cops and pinged everyone it would just ping them
you can be allowed to read a channel without being allowed to type in a channel
also the actual answer is i'd supress @everyones lol
supress yourself
<@120675876043096066>  submit you are turn you are retarde
games patched so presumably the servers are broke
oh nice
another patch
two in a day baby
n i ce
i should test that bodyguard thing and see if i can get 3 patches in a day
oh cool
automatic inside dominions delete doesn't take away winter map images
lmao
what
go to your maps folder
ooh deleting a map
is there a winter map image for every test game ive ever made
probably yeah
ok turn 3 herne is 752 years old
herneia more like
turn 6 herne is 1500
g fucking g illwinter
do you think its somehow possible that herne aging hundreds of years a turn is working as designed and thats why they have ignored me in the last 6 bug threads
the thing he actually hunts
is his pension
they fixed many other bugs i reported
https://twitter.com/mckayfelt/status/958096190087708672
<@96715337440952320> guess which beta tester wrote this "boudas are surprisingly decent thugs too, if you don't feel like skelly spam. they are a bit low on hp but that is fixable."
max wilson
wow ur so smart
but i could believe a number of sources
is that him?
yeah
someones asking how to use boudas and people are like "yeah you sneak them around and cast earth power> horde of skeeltons
and he kramers in saying what if you give them a brand
once they cast stoneskin they are practically invincible
i'm going to be amused if this undisciplined bg thing actually works because presumably being able to bg commanders is one of the weaknesses to nations with lots of undisciplined dudes
hows it work
i can test
looks to me like it doesnt work
i set 1 rus spear guy whos not undiscipled to guard commander
filled out his squad with rusian hunters who are
and set the commander to attack
the hunters moved into range and started using their ranged weapons while the spear guy and the commander charged into melee
i cant be fucked to test for assassins
<@282646158218756116> 
create a bg squad with normal dude, insert 4 undisciplined guys, remove normal dude, insert last undisciplined, don't touch other orders (moving units is fine)
yeah they are not actualy bodyguards
at least not in combat
ah well
they act exactly as undisciplned
what if you command the commander to hold
maybe for assassin fights
do the troops hold
the assassin side is still semi-interesting but a bitch to test yeah
though i think jomon la likes to spam ninja assassins
does any nation get both assassins and spies
they act just like you would expect undisciplined dudes to act jon joe
la man jj
although they have to summon the assassins
troubadors are effectively spy assassins
also la mari i think
not true jsoh dominions has lile
like
barely any female commanders
yeah do you know what happens
when you try to seduce someone who doesnt wanna bang
oh does that work on men too?
i didn‚Äôt know that
lol
it works on anything
seducers are basically assassins without patience
so impatient to bang
also even when you have a female seducer
there are a shit ton of things that do not want to bang!!
like niefel giants who do not care for puny humans
another good feature: you can make sure 99% of things are not dtf by wearing a bear claw
is there actually size restrictions on seduction
i know you cant flying seduce someone whos too big
i dunno but i know everytime i've tried seducing anything vaguely non human its gone "they weren't even interested yooo"
seduction is strictly better than assassination in every way which is a nice moral
you can definitely go at least 1 size higher because that's how you get incas as pan
it would make sense honestly for niefel giants to be asexual
which given the font of mythology that dominion draws from is fucked up
they were born from calving glaciers
the glacexuality meme
mate have u ever seen a niefel giants dick? i havent.
icened male at birth
good news everyone my olms are shooting again]
olm no
looks like there was an update
[8:00 am] jsoh: whys it trillwinter and not illwinter i feel attacked
i made it that way
i can change it back though
olms suck
why did you get owned by them then
no i used them and got ownde
idiote

*is destroyed instantly*
i approve of onis
2, in fact
naksu hasn't update snek yet so no point worrying about it
can man cast spells again
a man is entitled to his own spells, yes
or did they just fix olms
they said they fixed man
and olms
it wasnt olms btw
it was the fire closest order for any unit with a ranged weapon
herne is still 8000 years old right
yeah
v good
whom've is herne
the lord of the hunt
when you cast the wild hunt in dominions five he gets around 300 years older every turn
lol
it's good
what would even cause that
time dilation
dog years.
holy shit
mu is a genius
no
how can you look upon any of this man's works and call him a genious and not a psychopath
clowns.dm

!details

which battle?
so i had a werewolf with a shroud and frost brand, and a scout in a province. the scout picked up the frost brand, and then the werewolf transformed into a sneaky wolf who cannot wear shirts.
the shroud seems to be just ....gone
do i basically have to reset my turn's actions to get it back? shit
‚ò∫
hey <@190292302785150976>  and <@170661706421370880>  do your turns please it's been like 2 full days now
chop chop
you do!
have fun
did you fix the server
jerek please
okay i‚Äôll do it when i‚Äôm home
cursed things generally dont get picked up in this way
yes bug squash
sorry was asleep and / or busy until right now decreppo
on it though
are the servers unfucked?
its patched
cool
does this patch do a single thing that is interesting
solution: someone make a new game so i can play
i used to be good enough to survive until the lategame back in the dom3 days
mu 5.12 included "stat changes", so maybe
did someone sub for iloveu in stupidrobot?
it looks like he took his turn
multiple
both the one where you murked 200 hatuc ranas
and then also a small skirmish

heres a cool cost-saving tip for ea ermor: give every single one of your theurgs and arch theurgs shrouds, to make them sacred, thus reducing their upkeep.
better: cast life after death and kill alal of them, making them soulless who dont have brains or require a paycheque
so this is infinite value.. heh.. not bad
i do not care enough about one shroud to reset my turn 72
ea machaka: take half-dead and give all your spider spies bane venom charms
at 7 death per aids commander, its a steal!
i too crash viewing that battle
they made half dead be only 80% disease resist instead of 100 so its completely worthless dogshit
bvc still wont disease you immediately
its like playing xcom, 20% is 0%.
oh also machaka has disease healers so you can pass the torch w two monkey tribe scouts too i guess
can dom spread chance from preaching exceed 100%
like a prophet preaching at a temple gets 1 temple check and half a temple check for being level 4.5
bvc diseases you immediately
wehen you put it on
it does
it diseases anything that puts it on
its like losing an eye when you put on an eye
or chest wound for a heart

lol boing
hell yeah
i cant remember who it was but that was the golem fight game
(chalmers voice) why is there smoke coming out of your army seymour
golems are mindless s othey cant get into magic duels right
much like your posting.
that doesnt even make sense
although i cant get into magic duels, because it is clearly p2w
lol
has anyone ever used inner sun
is it a big explosion or a lil explosion
and can it kill a vampire
its pretty big i think
i mean for 1 fire gem i could cast it on every single theurg and arch theurg
so if the vampire did, idk, whatever vampires do, they explode onto him. good right?
i dont think a theurg is likely to melee a vampire
cast flight on your theurg
doesnt the vampire fly
vampires are wizards
they do wizardy things
and dont punch
what
thats not very vampirish
i thought they were thugs
<@170392794706214912> i need lots of nature gem now and i will pay you later please cede to my demands
i'll sell them for 60 gold a gem
i will do 25
!details

ma man went ai??
you've had mother oak going for like 2 years, you have plenty of nature gems
2 destroyed by non casting
interesting assumption
i certainly have plenty of nature gems' worth of stuff
does shroud really reduce upkeep
you've convinced me though. 55 gold per gem
nobody fucking pays 55 gold per gem lmao
nobody pays 100 gems for someone to invade an unguarded border but that was cryle s offer to me
fair is fair
someone was like "you probably ave lots of nature gems" to me , in the game where i have been at war for 30 turns
because i have moa
k
and 3 other nature globals
that looks like a guy whos been saving
a moaking accident
riidi every gem you send me is going into lars production which is going into elfing mictlan
if you had sent me the massive gem request i made last year, he would be gone now, and there would be no vampires.
imo i should have cast eyes of god first
(a)lways (b)e (c)asting (d)eog
cowards
i will never ai
!turns
not yet
well cryle every pound of gold you send me will go to elfing him and fomoria
your move creep
never seen such a decrepid log on the donair cam.
<:unhealth:373227653567610880>
t
might see a new log. great stuff.
a maimed donner
riidi if you become the zerg to my protoss you know what happens? the terrans win
i'm perfectly willing to trade or sell you gems but it has to be for a fair price my friend
ok how about this
you like fire brands right?
you love em.
i got em
ill be your thug kitchen, and cook you up some dryads
hmmm no
that wont get embarrassingly massacred due to lack of understanding of game mechanics
are you trying to sell brands to pan lol
man idk what this guy wants
hes inscrutable
i want gold
pan has its own brand identity
called "making a lot of bug"
his motives remain unknown
i lost five dryads because people on here lied about move ‚Äì patrol. it doesn't surprise me that buffwood crow about it as if it were a major defeat but it does surprise me that you are pretending it is
hes starting to move guys to the border
riidi what specifically do you think we lied about wrt move patrol
it wasnt a lie, its people in this channel are kind of idiots
the moving army definitely contributed to his patrol strength
move patrol definitely does not do destealth
it definitely did. he had no troops, and then a stack of 50 eagles patrolling me out
it's very possible you got unlucky but move and patrol is just move and defend province rather than castle
also as an anti seduce measure i think he is making and thugging civatateos
civitato
he tried to elf me with his first one and rammed it right into solar rays :cawg:
honestly that he hasnt beat you yet is pretty damning
!details

it was also a really weird coincidence that 3 players attacked me right on the same turn he asked me for a 2nd nap very strange
yeah well i wasn't the one who fell over myseld to nap him cryle!!
oh yeah i fell over myself to take gems from a guy im not planning to attack anyways
20 gems is a lot of gems!! for nothing!!
he's been in your 2-ring with a good unique site all game
where's your aggression
xibalba, vigil of the sun    eliminated
https://i.imgur.com/2dm3yxb.png
and this turn:
i can only attack so many things at once!!
anyways next turn i can probably spare you 1k gold
ill do 30g per nature gem
the no mekone game
the objective of the game is ot make mekone go away, then everyone else is the winner
donair update: still no remount
just received my yearly profits from the steam workshop, boys: a big ¬£74.99.
drinks are on me.
pretty brutal meat slab, imo,
clowns.dm dota skin pack pays off again
on reflection, the dota hero "tusk" is the one best suited for a clown skin - ice shards could form a big top, the snowball could be a clown car, and his totem could easily become a distracting trapeze
the clown hero has to be a 1 position
it's mirana and her mount becomes a unicycle and her sacred arrow becomes a pie.
i just had adota game where the enemy queen of pain died in lane 13 times
and my tinker , laning against her, got 18 minute boot of travel
lmao
did he at least have a dagon 10 at this point
i was like "well this jug im laning against is free farming but tinkers huge so nbd"
no he had null talisman bottle
lol
mu what does starfall turn into
confetti
pub tinkers don't do anything though even with a 50k gold lead.
dem updates
he was farming

with level 2 march
for 5 minutes

good way to clear 4 camps in total over 5 minutes
ancient gaming
does tinker ult refresh nullifier
ya
i think that may be a quite powerful combo w/infinite farm
only stuff it doesnt is mek arcanes linkins refresher orb and meteor hammer i think
also necro midas a few other things
oh yeah
where is the nullifier blink bot treble divine pro replay
the big play is blink shadow blade 3 rapier + the dumb invulnerability item on monkey king
since his statues things still do full damage while hes not allowed to do damage
lmao
and immune to damage
how the fuck do you two even play both dominions and dota
aeon disk wins again
it takes a certain level of intel of gents
if they dust u to find you in shadow blade just get hit
very carefully absum
jsoh probably does it because its winter and the oil pipes are frozen or w/e
honestly i sometimes do dominions turns while farming in dota
waht
ok i def cant do that
shift a click 3 camps
set my research and order some moves or whatever
easy
set my research and buy mages - this is my last resort
this is also how im in like 5-8 dominions games and it doesnt bother me: i only pay attention to stuff if its funny
probably a bad thing but , it took me 3 turns of my god burning 10 gems to summon earth elementals after a battle vs a single scout ended for me to notice what was going on
set research and buy mages
review the turn report
see i did it better
i need turns
maybe if you were better at lyrics you would get the

never attack with armies
that's too easy though.
just wait and unrest events will drown them
donair update: log still tawdry
:fans self:
armies suck
attack with good thoughts
how or why nazca is still alive is not meant for us mortals to understand
because i was busy and now it has metastatised and will have to be dealt with properly

why so many fucking ai
reset

guess it doesnt really matter tho
oh no who is caelum i cant tell because they didnt register
i am helpless to offer this olive branch of friendship
its a wish
actually
thank god there's no way to check this shit
or else you would stop me from destroying caelum
wtf
i played this turn
a long ass time ago
i guess i never submitted
but doctor.. i am caelum
no better position to destroy than from within
ill never get tired of seeing things like "stat fixes" in changelogs
okay this has got to fucking stop
i've forgotten pd in my provinces for like
the past infinity turns
doesnt matter what game
this province had twice as many hill wizards as i was expecting.
whats the gold bonus per admin?
1%?
2%?
what
its the amount of admin
admin is what money and res you draw as a percentage
from the neighbouring provinces
i dont think money is a 'from surroundings' calc
i believe it is some insanely lame thing like 1/2 the admin value over 100 as flat gold
that doesnt sound right either, depending on what you mean by over 100
modified income = (population / 100) * (dominion scale modifiers) * (1 +
fort administration / 200).
hmm it's more important than i thought to income
thats the same as population * domscalemode * (1+fort admin)/2000 which is...
well its a really tiny number
unless they mean like
thats the bonus gold calc
that gets added onto the base gold calc
ya modified income is about on top of base gold
base gold = pop / 100
modified = all the other stuff
so 20 admin is like a 10% bonus, 70 is 35%, which is quite a big deal on big provs
2000*
not 2000
20000*
wow i cant type 0s
who the heck gets 70 admin forts
the best city forts are like 70
a lot have 60 in la
giants get 45 admin at the cost of 1500 gold over 10 turns
rip
if they're mekone they get insanely good admin forts
however the nation is absolutely irredemable shit so there we go
it takes a giant fort
66.6 turns to pay itself off
lmao

new galaxy brain plan:
good times
2h damage bonus is real
recruit only barbarians
whats the 2h damage bonus
additional str multiplier
how much
.5?
.2?
1.0?
how so
jbrereton - yesterday at 6:45 am
arcane finesse + withering weapons = enemy sacreds with mr under about 20 get crushed to a comical degree
according to a really beefy giant its 1.2272
total
so .2272 bonus
probably actually like .25 though
*stacks 4 strength bonus on a jaguar*
now its a 5 strength bonus

<@!205774730244915202> is living up to his epiphet


all hat no cattle
wow already
whaaaat mictlan is ai too
jsoh wtf
this game is approp named
warcrimes needs restarting
good battle to watch
cant believe the demon army lost to the guys whomst've's research mages are priests, and also, automatically summon more priests.
<@275205678010859520>
k
@ridley wheres the turn!
server's restarted. should be good to go now
<@282646158218756116> did yr mictlan get owned by anime somehow?
yes
was it shortbows?
it was five points of fire resist being fifteen points of fire resist
??
if a demon has 5 fire resist, it counts as 15 fire resist for solar weapons
my bless sucks
and isnt good enough to win a fight without the solar weapons
but solar weapons do minus six damage
but also shortbows
and also i cant be fucked to play a blood guy honestly
can an earth snake be a disciple
ye
dom3-4 are leader
2-1 disciple
!details

after ten thousand years im fre
e
someone host a disciple game
i will not
i am strongly considering going ai after getting hill wizarded
what turn
3 i think
a powerful ai
also after jsoh revealed my entire game plan in chat
someone host a disciples game
not, like, tonight, since i have to go to bed now, but
also <@184675842432040960> how many hours are left in the turn. i need to knoe when i have to carve out time by
a disciples game, but people are only allowed to team up with their wife
my wife does not play dominions five
and samog is not your legal wife
force her imo
borat
i could probably teach her to play but she would not enjoy it
i believe you can convince your wife to play one game
she is more of a sims and words with friends kind of player
and so could kong ming, and riidi, and uhhh
i have played torchlight coop with her
she made me play sims for a bit and i made a macabre haunted house with a field of graves
doesnt your wife want to be famous on you tube
.25 i thought
no
guys
i lost this game already i am the worst
i don't even care look at this screenshot
https://imgur.com/a/bekk4
i have humiliated myself and am considering going ai at turn 2
<@120675876043096066> is there a reason you keep partialing
you guys want to see the most embarassing gosh darn thing in the world
yeah
i always look at my turn as soon as it turns over
but do not always have time to do it
am i last again?

oh wow
go ai
oooh
yeah
picking a carp is very embarssing yes
i hit r a couple times and it seemed promising
<@170392794706214912> 17 hours
celestial crap amirite
nice
you are doing worse than me
why did you take your troops with bows and katana into the sea
why would you even try to expand with a carp
he has water breathing gift
i assume that was the play
foiled by jomons being jomon
not anyomre
alas
my tears will flood the world
should not have made aka oni samurai
in ocean slash is -length attack
shoulda just made more ashigaru
that is good information i did not have
i should've taken horses down there
lol
just for comedy
its prominently displayed in, uhh
jomon horses are super bad
the manual i guess.
its prominently displayed in a random tip probably and no where else
assuming even there
i did better in my ea r'leyh game
cool so i can take it tomorrow morning
you didnt have a carp i nyour ea ryleh game
worse i had a mind lord
but at least he lived more than 2 turns
its really hard to kill a mind lord you suck
your words are as cruel as they are accurate
who is lemurs in capitalism?
why do you refuse to register ganjdalf the purple
death to all bots
butlerian jihad did nothing wrong
the bot is good. the individual game channel is evil
iod
woah
hot take
go forth, and kill
genernal chat is hella dumb to read when people are talking about 3 different games at each other
its "win"
<@170392794706214912> did i say 17 hours i meant 17 minutes
what is this crap
<@282646158218756116>
what
whys there a channel for this game.
jesus.
because someone made some idiot a mall cop and he makes one for every fuckin game
q to class: can you receive an affliction from any damage, or just being slashed and poked and stuff
if you did then i already staled so nbd
who will save us from the tyranny of the mall cops.
well, he attacked my cap with his forge lord solo, it ded
????
he didnt do that on purpose
his forge lord was lost in the void for over a year
when you get out of the void you kind of just end up wherever you end up
oh i see
well, i killed one god this game, anyway
its actually extemely not win and stupid
and im saying that as someone who does it with 1 person, the two of us being the only people who are in that particular game
and i post pictures sometimes
i seduced a mind lord and brought it to land where it drowned
fravishi? more like qqvashi
<@170392794706214912> pleas efind it in ur heart to finish ur turn. dont let the triangle become the treality

i think jsoh was upset by solar weapons having some resistance issues and foresaw that i would be stepping on him soon
sorry about the late turn, got hit by a car yesterday and was less concerned about afflictions in game
how the fuck did my pretender get zero kills vs hordes of monkey chaff
too busy singin.
[5:24 pm] cryle: i need turns so badly i joined other dom5 discords and they're all weird. one is just people roleplaying as exotic fruit
thats this one
but we're erping as exotic fruit instead
i'm in as durian
this is not going well
i didn't realise how important it was to distribute gems to my mages in the field

hello friendly water neighbour
well, goongratulations on surviving

wrt affliction damage
turns out having 10 h2 priests charge your cap works?
but yea: leak maps, leak graphs
info must be free
literal cabinet leaks, yes
its very good
.tag conot recuperation bless
never playing a nation without a recruitable h3 mage ever again
my pretender feebleminding himself and my bishopfish being trapped underwater thanks to ice seas has fucked me so hard
literally at 10/11 throne point with forces on 2 more thrones right now i'm the newbie game
lol
time for the construction 8 holy boosters
i had a good early and mid game, but damn am i doing nothing in the late game. i should have dozens of plague casting mages

is there a chance for hidden underneath to not create a mage?  
i got everything else but i can't find the mage i was expecting
yes
the hidden stuff is all chancey
cool, thanks
fuck you i'm a dragonfruit
that's the point of erp fruit
im gonna do it
im gonna start a pankor system game
whats the best age
ma
i was just thinking about starting a game
wanna try out samogbot's lobbies?
what is pankor system
its a map my friend made based on dawn of war: soulstorms campaign map
lobby command is " !lobby {ea/ma/la} <num_players> [<alias>]"
i'm not expecting it to 100% work right first time
https://i.imgur.com/krjinmb.jpg
here is the map
!lobby ma 20 bad-boys-of-pankor
<@184675842432040960>: creating game lobby with name bad-boys-of-pankor
it just made a channel called "bad"
that map is bad so fititng
!list

um that is now 12 slots lmao
oh it's 20 and intended
20, jeez
so when it fills up do i still need to set up hosting
cryle does this come with a 20 faction warhammer 40k pack
or whats the heal
it can but i choose not to use it
cryle - make a game on snek as normal
i'll take care of making samogbot aware of the address and give turns etc
gonadic io can there also be a all ages setting
eventually yes
!register nazca bad-boys-of-pankor
<@185694323407454218>: registering ma nazca for <@185694323407454218>
yes
k
ermor banned? pan?
please as a gentlemens agreement: ermor and asphodel banned
ah okay, sure
actually is asphodel banworthy
i'm 90% sure nazca is bad but everyone is gaslighting me
their popkill is like .10 or something right?
i'm planning to pick g2 or 3 too if that helps
yeah sure you can be asphodel thats fine
im in a game with fucking ermor right now so how bad can it be
or i could be c'tis
i just wanna be a popkill nation
never done one before
ok
ermor banned, anyone else okay
admins <@282646158218756116> please make a channel called bad-boys-of-pankor so i don't have to type that out every fucking time
woot
yeah there will be samogbot lobby bugs
but just ping me and i'll fix them asap
is ctis domkill?
possibly not, i'm bad and new
ctis is not domkill
unless you're not ctis
they dom disease, which is an absolute pain
ctis is dom increase money and poison things
everyone not cold-blooded
its dominion is, much too strong imo
probably best non-broken ma nation
it's up there with ulm for sure
nazca is insanely not bad
also fuck i don't want a channel for every fucking game i hate you all
make a alias for your game that isn't shit
no way they're great. mute all games you're not in
hide muted channels
boom
you can do that??
ive muted every single game channel actually
i think current ma is like
-> ermor
-> pan

-> nazca/ulm/ctis
right click the discord server icon (the gem for this one)
pangaea is allowed but we have a gentlemens agreement to turbofuck them asap
pangaea should be banned
the bad nations game is called "new bad nations"
the robot knows it as "bad"
how bout we just politely agree to let a retard idiot newbie play pangaea for balance reasons
no
alias away your awful naming choice
cryle you cannot turbo fuck someone in dominions really
again: ive been fighting 5-6 nations, with the first war starting on turn 8
in the game where im nazca
2 of those i was fighting are dead
and it took like 30 turns to lose something that mattered
and im not even playing well
idk dude ive eliminated someone in  two years in half the games ive played
<@255835336083636234> please ping the mall cops to make some garbage channel for you
ok? pan is not going to lose to someone in two years
<@&389931813528797184> please make a bad-boys-of-pankor channel
i hate it and dont want to and also im nude and in bed
same
it's called pankor
link it
just name the channel pankor
fine i'll change the alias to pankor
why are game channels still not banned
i'm theo
because they 1) make interacting with the bot easier, and 2) keep spam out of the main thread
they're great
they serve the semi useful service of not pinging the normal chat with main thread
just mute any hide any games you're not in
how do you hide muted channels
right click on the ruby
is atlantis ai or is corbeau still playing?  brainwrinkle says ai: the bot says he's not ai.
!details

i just want to know if i'm about to be rolled by the ai or by a person.
@jsoh ok how do i turbo fuck as nazca?
have high air on your pretender
thunder weapons quicknes has been nerfed a bunch because its fucking broken
but it's still very good
a pretender that has thunder weapons quickness bless can make 20 condors which are sacred a turn
ez
and you kill the first person you see, almost universally
if anyone has a bless big enough that their sacreds can fight yours they certainly will not have a hundred sacreds by the end of year 1
try to buy air gems but that probably wont work lol
i played very poorly and should have killed 2 people much faster
the big weakness you have is condor have 8 mr so giants with more hp and bv will kill them maybe kind of
all of those ma giants?
ok u have con vin ced me
by the way i vastly prefer for the main chat channel to be an unending river of garbage
no pangaya
squash theres some giants in ma on nations that want blood for sure
then once nazca is out of the early game phase where if you play well you have twice as much income as anyone else even through 9 negative scales you have the most powerful recruitable mages in the game
<@184675842432040960> you can actually right click any blank spot in the right bar to get to the option too
i did it
congrats
now you no longer have to read dead channels like <#380121471298568202>
w t f
donair cam owns
ill keep donair cam ty
if u mute donair cam you should probably not mention it
pelagia went ai
sign of mental deviance
purge this anime idiot who does not appreciate donair cam
ok, i will set out as turbo rush nazca
!details

it's clear that people with anime avatars have superior opinions imo
the bot doesn't lie friend.
its true
also brainwrinkle is inherently a mess to read
as an aside condors are the most efficient patroller and sieger that exist in the game as far as i can tell
as well as being murder machines
imagine if pale riders was conj 3 and also gave you a good unit
a sacred unit
that flies
pale riders gives you a good unit
and is also the most stealthy unit that exists with a huge patrol bonus and siege bonus
it's called a long dead horseman, and they're quite useful
more like short lived horseman, ha ha ha ha ha
ya i think condors are taking a nerf brick in jbbm v5
in terms of numbers summoned at the absolute least
a pale riders focused pretender can make  44 a turn or some shit
arent they like 9++ or something
which is enough to fuck people up
also i'm mildly amused that <@306995014578470916> went from killing his own pg with cold aura and having his cap sieged to back to functional status purely by merit of people going ai like idiots
10++
for 9 gems
ya you can get like 50 longdead horse in one cast or, powerfully, 50 in two casts by like 2 liches who just got made a lich
if it was 6 for 9 gems i think it would still be a useful spell that was maybe both underpriced and too fast to get to
what is the quickness change?
sick got a javascript error on the dom inspector, thanks chrome
the quickness change did not stop like 60 zhaedyn w/quickness from killing like 3-400 bogarussian cav
good news
apparently it was making things attack too fast
o-ok
event rarity: common or rare
as a commander for ma asph: nature gemprod, or carrion dragon
get the stag man what you can see his penis hanging down
there are no recup or regen emoticons
sad
is there a way to get rid of channels showing up under games
or is this just going to accrue and accrue
until there are like 40 game channels to wade through
see! nobody knows!
when scrolling down
discord is so bad at things
eventually some of these games will end
you mute the channnel and right click hide muted channels on the gem
<@179427307386044416> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/372490951391838221/408266654292901898/unknown.png
oh my goddd
yeah do that. mute and hide
extremely intuitive
who designed this garbage
someone younger then irc
think emoji
probably
kids these days

or are centaurs enough to expand with and i can get dormant?
and get rid of trash turmoil for order
why not like
aspho is a popkill nation and running order is a waste of time
you have to run order luck magic ya
all my mages are sacred so reinvig seems good
fire & shock also though yes
i mean it's 2 reinvig
it's not that huge
isn't withering weapons bad? does it have short term effects as well as the increased aging?
withering weapons is very good
i mean who gives a shit if the militia guy is 10 years older
it does damage as well as aging
oh cool
and you have multi attack sacred undead manikins
although probably their spawn rate is tied to high levels of dom or some other abysmal trash as befits one of the worst ma nations
üò¢ you're making me not want to play them
are they really that bad?
they're probably a bit better nowadays
but your money goes off a cliff in year 2
did brainwrinkle fix the number registration thing
as does your recruitment
no
you have to play aggressively
http://www.brainwrinkle.net/games/430
for 1 patch they were insanely good
don't use brainwrinkle and the bot together
and then their domkill got increased and they were made progressively worse with cost rebalances
i meant when the lobby is full you need to make it on snek.earth <@184675842432040960>
now they are a research 0 castle doer but they have other things they really need to spend their n gems on
moak
and maybe one castle. you must... acquire other castles
from other players
moak / more commanders / swarm / foul vapors
which means you have to put a bless on your centaur to kill someone in y1
while also buying g3l3m3
and at least like 6 dom
also you only get to buy centaur a little while because your cap depops and its impossible to buy them anymore forever after that
then you must rely on the powerful saggitarian carcass
you must have boomed powerfully in the early game to have money and therefore rp
and transition to mage supported vine trash
no dryad crutch so you have to legit win things
1n1w gemgen doesn't seem great for a pretender
she's very underpriced which is nice
thats twice as much gemgem as most gemgems!
really makes u think
<@184675842432040960> delete the brainwrinkle lobby or the bot lobby please
ultimately you need an actual expander tho
you cannot be a 15 province haver on that faction
your actual expander is 3 centaur warriors im certain
ok bw lobby gone
https://i.imgur.com/gazltif.png
is my saved guy
oh and abuse tunes
the pg doesn't regen though so you need to be like super friggin careful with them
they buffed them insanely
tunes are wild atm ya
regen sounds bad since pg and many many mages dont get them
ya it does send a fluffer

you fluff god with regrowth
!details

prophet your harpy
sure but you don't need
to spend anything to get that
points wise
regen is to avoid attrition
i get it but do they even attrition
yes
centaur do limp. unless you want to wait that's a death. regen cuts afflict cost
and regen will of course add functional hp
don't take turmoil 3 lol
it doesn't matter the popkill is so bad
really
yes. try them now
i have not tested them at all
it's 1%/candle atm i believe
bc are 46 points right?
lmao
31
what
pans pay 2/3 always
it's pan
in the fuckin world
you rube
you can buy 5 with t3 until popkill brings it down to 4 in a few turns
which is enough
how arw they cheaper than ermor knights
fuck youuuhu
!details

pan needed the buff okay
imagining a 21 hp sacred cav unit with multiple attacks would be cheaper than eponi knights
just lol
but <@255835336083636234>  you have to be pro tier with the tunes
or you lose the game
so be good at them
dom5inspector says tunes are pan only
what changed on tunes
not asph
giganto aoe
lol what did they take away tunes from aspho
oh ya they might have binned them for aspho actually
<:pan:372896697317064705>
thats messed up
no more pbaoe twenty five fear
pan only sorry
yes that is the actual aoe
is the tune of scare enemy only
ofc
why would pan be scared of their own songs
20, jeeeeez
that doesn't make any sense
are you sure?
you could also do aoe twenty five 31 stun damage
these are n1 ench 0
why would morale be a problem for pan ever
a murder blessed centaur from a random tree who is leading 5 wc can do it
in melee, because lol you have to hit him
give them combat caster imo
they don't even need it
1 guard centaur
remember when samog put out dark skies and routed a bunch of centaurs by doing one damage and having them fail the morale to berserk
nice
no its not going to be 20
but the map has uhh, 350+ tiles
but like i have cleared 25 cap pd with 0 losses with 3 white centaur and a centaur boss
by just haveing him do aoe entangle 25 and then aoe 25 fear until they won
n1 ench 0 lol
is there rolls on these spells
31+ stun is mr negate
others are no resist get pan fucked
there's room for 13 land starts, 1 or 2 cave starts, and uhh, 4 water starts?
is the fatigue cost 0
no it is very expensive
5
with tune use pan retains the unique first hit mechanic
cause you count squares to stop moving close but not too close, and cast
so the bad guys get near and then are all entangled + die
bless / hold / attack / songs
maybe i should play 2 nations
so waht you are saying is the correct response to being against pan is to be ermor or get fucked
for when asphodel eats itself
you can always ban pan... if you are a coward
does la get to keep the songs
yes according to the inspector
or i could go dom2 asph and prefer centaurs over the freespawn
nah that's not a doable thing
shit
unless you mean mundane army centaurs
no i meant cap ones
ok so how does dom 2 work with that
popkill at dom2 is about neutral with growth 3
ok...
on the other hand you can buy... 2... at most
so you can keep recruiting in your cap
oh shit yeah forgot about that part
2 of them
nm
ya lol
you could go non bless low dom
regular warriors are still pan units
just use your cheap asphodel temples to bring your dominion/domkill up so you can recurit more!
asphodel seems like its legit bad, by accident
still has a touch of pan
so middling instead of bad
could always take the death 1 forge lord
carrion dragon is pretty badass tbh
https://i.imgur.com/fmmwdou.png
why not cold 3 tbh
sure it hurts to not walk good but you are pan it hurts everyone else more
fuck to snow
and i resist fire five
centauride heirophant is 21 defense to miss so she can sing her song
and she'd have a dude in her square
have you considered that you could do that with literally a kitfox monument
carrion dragons can't fly, wtf
they don't need to
and he's super cheap
just fluff with regen and he's a beast
carrion dragon has what 9 attacks
i will not take a fucking monument
and one of them is aoe
i will take that cool god who will do powerful things after i am on an opponents cap as he awakens
if you took cold 3 you could make him a thug...
also la pan has the tunes
and can cast flight
finally a cure for ragha
sing scary songs until the gryphons run away
ragha flat out insta loses vs pan
no just do the fatigue ones
mr negates 31 fatigue
they don't get to run away. all of them die
why isnt the robot a markov bot yet
31 an fatigue ofc
cause pan
hmm
if you kil lthe rider does the gryphon inheirit its morale penalties and fatigue
.markov jsoh
.markob pan
im pretty sure it's still tired isn't it
.markov pan
it just gets full hp and some affliction heal?
its all afflictions i think
or it should be since the first guy is dead
i can't remember if that's on new rider or on rider die
!turns
but with a dumb as hell bless you could do retarded stuff with a dryad on attack once tunes with a fly eth fluff
nice i have a turn
probably just fear actually
since thye have awe
the order "attack" always resolves before the order "make this guy fly"
well she'd bless on that turn
and you have fucking stymph burd guard
makes sense
you would entangle or generally fuck huge swathes of the enemy army

a 20 player game sounds like a fun excercise in one turn per 72 hours
i'm bot kryptonite
just never extend the timer fuckin easy
that sounds like a man who has never played an all ages game
26 hour and if anyone complains use the master password to set them ai
gg
26 hours? man, kids these days are spoiled
hmm
you need to submit a doctor's note for an extension, and i will ignore it and make you stale and laugh at you
is fear+blood vengeance ma agartha as good as i want it to be
i actually *have* a doctor's note right now
jsoh the real question is whether it is better than fear + bv ma tc geomancer pigsy guys
fuck to china
fear overall is not a particularly amazing bless though no i do not think
v much like awe
the other not that useful vs good nations bless
so then bv+ reconstruction
what about some :effort: bless like fire shield
w t f
why does agartha get the frost father
but kailasa no
cold god for cold blood
obviously
only asians need to be prevented from having the good god
asians and mekone lol get fucked
https://puu.sh/zdfwy/98adbb0e24.jpg
<@137038752370524161> the problem is that i'm a fucking idiot (and also didn't bother putting very much error checking in). give me 2 mins and try again
does agartha have heroes worth 40 design points
these heroes are pretty badass
i think bv might not be good idk this prob is bad also
bv seems pretty fuckign good to me
thanks <@255835336083636234>
i feel like most of the stuff that can damage their big statues especially would not care too much about bv due to quality mr but maybe ur right
is there anything cool in them
i guess they have those unarmoured boulder throwers to get carved up

how necessary is reconstruction really
idk are they not magic beings and so heal in a lab even with the never heal tag
does heal happen at the same time for lab needers as for not lab needers
no idea but why not
i dunno every time i've relied on preaching priests to get my dom up in a dom battle situation the results have been
unimpressive
but perhaps i just have shit luck
making your domscore above 3 so you don't instantly die to domkill events is not that though
yeah the thing that guy said would not have any thing to do with dominion fights
man this is physically painful
i can either have points left over
or take a good bless and also fuckin mountain survival
<@!160127200803160064> follow the manual as to how preach works
you need to use h2+
or take a less good bless and not mountain survival
if you do not have h2+ reconsider a very low dom score
cause h1 preach is ass
take mountain survival i m h o, never know when the map move will be useful
who summoned me
you fucked up your @

what do you mean
the bot took a lobby and a server address, and turned it into a regular game. plus it kept the registrations he between the lobby and the game
this means that the minimum possible lobby system is implemented now
create a lobby, people sign up, the owner goes away to snek.earth manually and then gives the address to the bot

the fact that arco gets healer (3) priestesses is *insanely* good
priestess is the best healer in the game so ya it's p good
it's a shame its on a nation that tends to lose most of its units outright rather then get a billion afflictions
it's for the wizards
fuck to units let them die
wizards and maybe elephants. everyone else can die
yeah, your mystics and your philosophers
arco doesn't get elephants in ea, rip
uncrippling an elephant is pretty great value
i tested expanding with priestess leading elephant squads and it worked out fine actually
this was for la
mix in some slow as fuck hoplites with the armor elephants + priestess
she'd often clean up the limps instantly
the problem with priestesses leading
is they'll fix up all the stupid worthless cardaces with broken fingers an stuff
is panko running any mods
no
well the dumb slow shit stays behind, elephants run ahead and stomp stomp
the phalangites or w/e rarely even engage
they exist to increase squad size and average morale

i would glady pay you tuesday for a gemburger today.
oh yeah i guess it would.
i would have! now he wants "gems this turn, for pay this turn, and also at the same inflated rate"
this turn, because he'd be immediately sending the gold, he wants a discount.
can you believe this guy?
well fuck off retard, my 2n mage is already on the move and cant build more lars.
lars only need n1 to make
sorry i should have said "my n mage" as in, i have only ever produced one the entire game
we make a special gem just for you, same high price.
and it was a lar from a merc
throughout this game i have recruited 12 daktyl mages
not a single one has rolled death
it's a 1/5th chance

i find it very sad! that riidi fails to understand that i would be prepared to pay significantly more than a gem is worth on credit, than i would up front
woot
!details

hell yeah 2 hours to go
are you trustworthy
i have made many extremely shady gem deals in my time
at least once i made a gem deal with a guy i was invading, by using a third party.
so
no
he absolutely is not
if id sent him the gems last turn this turn he;d have said "oh uhh sorry some random events and upkeep meant i dont have enough gold to send"
"can i pay you half the gold and send back some other gems at a 1.5:1 rate favoring me?"
i have never actually broken my word regarding gems or gold on credit or a nap or anything
that, also, is not a believable statement.
and frankly i cannot be held to a price i offered on turn 45, for a deal on turn 45, when it is now in faxt turn 46.
it was not a deal on turn 45
you specifically said "i will do <x>"
that's weird i didnt receive any gems this turn
is the garbage truck okay
we need a blockchain for trustless gem trading
unf no
the truck drivers got hurt and the gop is ok
fucked up
cryle says he didn't receive gems, and as a person who has no investment in this either way and no clue i trust him

what is grandpas closet
it's not ready for dom 5
it was a game with like one thousand two hundred provinces
lmao
i thought about it
grandpas closet was on a 1400 province map with 30 players os rsomething
that's too many provinces.
it is
it's very bad
foreverwar ftw.
it was so big you couldnt load the game properly
you had to download the turns
doesn't it need a winter overlay or something
crash the game
then play locally
connect ot the server, crash the game again
it was great
winter overlay is not required i dont think
in awe at the size of this map. absolute unit.
winter overlay is not required no
you just cant see snow at a glance
im in 5 games and i've gotten like 1 turn in a week

well shit, i'll start cooking up the closet sometime then

honestly on a map this big pelagia is more harmful to the game than ermor
yeah. i wasn't kidding when i said that ermor = pelagia

no. pelagia

i could change to rlyeh i have a gimmick build ma rlyeh i could do

wow
it involves an uttervast space ship

what bless do i give ancient ones and shart guards that lets them kill water elementals under water
uhhhh

and uhh statues or whatever
bv?

i reckon maybe all the blesses ought to do it
14 strength
no, none of them
none of them do it
oh hey it's warbeard
i bet all of them together would
oh. yes. that's a good idea
also use the faerun map, not the closet map
respect the classics
140 yogis
it's nowhere near as absurd
im such a dumbass
wait are you actually using the closet map im going to stab myself
cold weapons maybe?
boulder throw nad stone throw dont work uw do they
lol
why would cold weapons work
for the closet game
because no cold resistance?
they're resistant to everything
yeah but i won* a game on the closet map
probably just a lot of + strength and quickness
is all that would do it efficiently
and quickness is already pretty good on encumberance less statues
cryle its not a joke. on a map this b ig pelagia is way more cancerous than ermor
everyone will die to armageddon and maybe one or two players in the game will have had a chance to do anything about it
oh yeah i forgot larger is good
on this nation
what's that? we didn't have a major battle this turn
oh, can they just shit out wishes?
yes.
killed fucking 500 birb men, with 2k left to go it feels like
is it though? most of there good sacreds are size 3
or are you going real big
welcome to every nation in dom 3 tho
larger gives 30% hp to statues
which then gets more statue hp for golem dom
could you mod wish more expensive
that's not bad.
probably enough to make the big statues worth making
and also remove that global which is ridiculous in large games
<@169456837236621312> do you promise to not destroy the galaxy
also would make shart glaives length 4
which is p good but also would make them only fit 1 a square which is less good
yeah. that was my concern with sentinels/shart guards + enlarge
but the golem cult thing is worth it
of course not cryle
i will destroy the galaxy
why is plegaria so bad? plenty of other wish casters out there
pelagia can wish for gems
they make pearls
i can be rlyeh instead and not destroy the galaxy tho

then they cast nexus and turn all of the other gems to pearls
i wouldn't cast nexus
i would just destroy the galaxy and bring peace
nexus is always broken in large games
nexus is best when you overwrite it with stellar focus
(lol jb)
i will probably not cast burden of time
unless someone like just gives me a bunch of gems and asks me to. then i will do it for sure
there is only one solution
cataclysm turn 1
someone else should do burden of time though
mostly because i would never care
you are only allowed cataclysm turn 5 unfortunately
oh good i can still get a refund
but yeah as pelagia all you have to do is wish for gems if pearls < 200 and wish for armageddon if > 200
and it is a self sustaining engine
and in a game like this, i would very carefully hoard as many as i could so that the turn i got alt9 i could just start chain casting a good 3-4 times
https://puu.sh/zdntg/41c24ad769.jpg https://puu.sh/zdnpn/0fa80f48dc.jpg which is better
wish endgame is crazy
i would kill everyone and then the horrors would be welcomed as liberators
it's like illwinter built them for it on purpose. the pearl kings are high hp so they generally survive armageddon
and have the pearl xmute ability
what death god do you take to expand
as who
pelagia
doggo
oh
fuck pelagia
assuming you have death god for bot
i wouldn't take death
what do you need a death god
you take a astral god , for wish
oh right. that makes more sense
i would take a high s god who also has some blesses for knights so i could go kill ys
uh rude
reminder that you could start on different planets
they look connected
monkey tell me which pretender is better
and uttervast is a space ship
i hate them both
protogenos of the sea would be hilarious on this map
we‚Äôre basically just swapping provinces and troop loss
lmao
what does he do?
teleport
he can move to every water province in the game
sadly attack rear crab claw strategems no longer work he'd die
oh fucking l o l
i have successfully stormed a cap with uttervast in 8 enemy candles solo though
so expect bullshit
how did you break walls
whats a agartha pretender then
i gatewayed an army to break the walls
cheater
then uttervast stormed, alone
and won easily
that's still good
i have to decide if i am going astral corruption uttervast or burden of time uttervast though
big decisions
how does dog of the underworld expand
poorly
you said no burden of time!
just by being really scary?
oh.
no burden of time rush
yes
expander god needs protection or ethereal or something to not get pucnhed a lot
i mean uttervast is dormant it's not even possible to rush effectively with him
whats banned for pankor
man eldest cyclops has a tiny fuckin head
ermor pan
maybe you just have a big head
the coolest part of taking blood uttervast is researching blood four early as rlyeh
pan and ermor
which is completely insane in any other scenario
but he can leech touch, forever
someone whos not a idiot help me design a pretender please
sorry jsoh
sorry all idiots here
efb
i need to empower my floating mind in blood
ty for idea monkee
does this mean its time to slam dunk a pretender into the lemuria slot
he has innate also doesn't he
he does
i‚Äôm trying to pick the best awake expander for ma ulm
floating mind could be like idiot fucker moron version of uttervast
and a thousand times weaker
and then die
absum its a ma game
but, it would cast leech touch a couple times
so good luck

you got some negative points there jsoh
<@114740794476331015> reminder, in case you missed it
pankor is a middle age game
why do you want quick you don't need quick
idk dude . i guess i could go with the cyclops of resist every thing also
you probably want uhhh a risen oracle or something like your fire shield charge body thing
!details pankor

a 20 player ma game?
not all ages?
why
on a cool as heck map
larger + bv
because game host hates mods!
that‚Äôs why absum
risen oracle is fucking asssssssss
leader of the closed council on the other hand...
risen oracle is ed god with fucking chill and fear
how is he ass
immortal
that cyclops is confirmed to be able to expand with a trinket armor
idk
i killed one with like 4 trolls
in dom4
oh, what determines the starting research you have?
this is dom5
in dom5
just walked up and bopped his head off
because that is totally new to me
magic scales + random
lol what kind of piece of shit risen oracle loses to 4 trolls
it had regen bless i think
the death regen i assume
this is the game where i amde agartha go ai and then its ai immediately started rolling me with massed oracle blade winds
lol
is there any time the death regen isn't shit
if you‚Äôre lemuria
once you get to conjuration 9 its probbably good
lemuria could take a shit on the keyboard and it would work
i mean
that‚Äôs the play
except it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs keyboard
also imo in such a big game it‚Äôs weird that we‚Äôre keeping cata 69
what do you even take as a d bless on this nation either
https://puu.sh/zdoc8/b6cad057a7.jpg ???
withering weapons is bad
its really not
someone was saying that withering weapons + arcane finesse is good
but i don't know why or how
that doesn‚Äôt even make sense
well, the penetration affects punches with mr componenets
that part makes sense.
but i'm not sure how you're going to kill faster by making them age a bit every turn
the nation that wishes for more wishes
it does damage
oh shit really?
cryle make your game all ages
fuck you
lol
the only age i am interested in...
...is the space age
40k conversion mod when
ftw.
man wearing skull bandana: hey can we play in legal age
dormant floating mind can get quickness & fateweaving with 5dom and 1 (additional) negative scale. how's that for fighting ys sometime in year two and casting wish a bunch?
did u kno
there are 21 nature sites that produce a researcher
the next more frequent are fire at 13, and air at 12,
half of them are dogsit though
it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúresearcher‚Äù unless it‚Äôs more gold efficient than your next most efficient option
thats just like your opinion man
what is precision checked against
movement?
this shit should be in the manual
how much damage do wog bolts do and is it mr or prot checked
precision isn‚Äôt checked against anything
it just checks precision when they target a square to see how much it goes off course
if the range from attacker to target is greater than precision/2 ‚Äì 2 (half the precision, minus 2) then the
missile will deviate from the target. the amount of deviation is equal to the range x 1.25 / precision.
so that means, if you are like, a 15 precision angel or whatever and you fire an arrow, you need to be 7 tiles away for a guaranteed hit
wait no, 5 tiles.
guaranteed to hit the tile not the dude right?
prec counts double past 10
what
so the first 10 points are like 1,2,3,4 right
yeah if you are a 15 precision angel you are 20 for purposes of calculation
and then it's effective 12 14 16 etc. after
why? because <:illwinter:372894192894214176>
it hits a random unit in the square if not aoe
who then gets to block with a shield, if it applies
!details

maybe they were going to do it with bitmask values at one time monkee
<@205774730244915202> bruh
this incidentally makes agarthans even more shit prec wise than it may have appeared at first glanec
glance*
b/c even if you were an absolute madman and went prec +10 bless it would still be 6 worse than a comparable bless on a human faction
and the aim buff takes them from 7 to 12 rather than 10 to 18
cryle can you make the server so people can upload. also a server setting i would strongly suggest is setting story events to all
does this game have a cataclysm date
are we full
!details pankor

i want at least 14
theres no reason to be full before allowing uploads
yeah you can just host and let people upload
k
it would be cool as heck if there were actually 20
that would put it at 17.5 ppp which is not even terrible
definitely common events and story to all
69
hell........ pit on graphs
graphs are awful.
riidi are you even in this game
someone will god eyes in a 20 player game
so graphs will come
you can see i am right there cryle!!!
oh and bump the global limit
i cant. someone blinded mine eyes of god
don't leave it at 5 that'd be sad
yeah ill set it ot 7
what's a waste of gems you keep the graphs and info you already got
and it remembers sites
i hope bug squash takes exactly the pretender jb gave him
i've made a pretender that will either let me do well, or leave the game quickly
i tihnk twist fate is probably maybe better than luck for nazca tho
but mayben ot
nice.
brb
jsoh if i show it to you can i get your secret eval
sure
twist fate means you don't have to waste one hundred sixty design points
ok i'll do that when i get back home
also it requires less s

they parts that are good are the bats
and the mages
use wizards yeah
all i can change is password, turn timer, and map
https://twitter.com/venusasabun/status/958544250270093312
and the nationa lspells (do they even have the national spells)
they have frogs
oh you have to do those changes from the start
they have no blood xib stuff
precision values greater than 10 count double for the amount above 10. thus, a precision value of 12 is
actually calculated as precision 14.
ohmy god its in the manual
no national spells but they have way
huh weird it's like the people here are not trying to misinform you for no reason
and the uhh cave ones
both are good. you want to collect caves
camazotz
does space map have caves
space map has like 2 caves
4
one for xibalba one for agartha get fucked
space map has aan entire cave planet
oh that's fine
hmbol

jonjoe can't count
absolute scenes.
8
or is cave planet very smol
no indie zotz mod
please
cave planet is like 10 tiles
and i think it hosts 2 starts
i hope i start on a 10 tile planet with xibalba
but one start is adjacent to another planet
lmao
you mean, your 10 tile planet with 2 aps
dasharezone planet
where u share all ur tiles and sites
is there a black hole, which is a cave. if not, why not.
<@317410996169736204> they didn't want me to play pelagia and blow up the galaxy it was very fucked up
a cave w/ no province connections
name your prophet martin
and just blow up one other planet
cryle to change the settings for globals, and hall of fame, and site rarity (should be 50 probably since thats default for dom5) and events you need to change them on the make game screen and not the edit screen
real sad
with black death and tidal waves and shit
how many big provinces
er
just bizarre
name it marvin
marvin the martian
i am bad at this
next map should be 1 planet per tile
i expect the map is super imbalanced and one of the planets is like farm planet right
as is standard for custom maps
definitely monkey
perfect
although probably the most broken part of this map is how you can chokehold an entire planet from 2 provinces lol
thats uhh
wow
the map is epic. nuff said.
true of here as well - the suez and panama canals
i cannot be chokeholded
uttervast space ship does not follow your rules
theres 14 caves
excellent
https://dom5.snek.earth/maps/50
prepare for bat hell
theres 335 provinces not 350 cryle!!!!!
and ist 75 uw
nice estimates
41 manysites holy siht
i think ma agartha is going to win this game
this maps insane
should i unregister as ulm and reregister as jotun
dats a lotta water
75 uw you probably want another water nation at least or i will be a malignant cancer
i think i should
maybe 2 more uw
tfw theres more many sites than farms
sounds like it's time for ma shinuyama to shine
if we actually fill up the game you want 4 or 5 uw
the map file recommends 4 water nations
how many are even in ma
well monkee to travel to other planets where water is you‚Äôll need to go over land
tyler ocean ys atlantis pelagia
i do not
uttervast does not follow your laws of physics
you got the big 5 plus ys, agartha, xib and kinda sceleria and shinu
then therse , me, uuhhh
whats the big 5 am i fogeting one
there‚Äôs also technically aspho
oceania pelagia atlantis rlyeh ys
can maniknasns swim
no
oh
no aspho is not a secret uw faction
fucked up
oh right oceania exists i forgot
like everyone else does
because it's shit
honestly if you add oceania to the game it just means monkey gets 3 capitals
instead of 2
oceania can outfight rlyeh maybe but it is quite miserable to play
i actually tend towards water fuck the surface agreements in water games
unless my water neighbor is doing very bad, in which case i kill them and use their lands better
take a pretender capable of casting thetis blessing, gotcha
i welcome thetis blessing
one weird trick to own rlyeh, astral nations hate it
all are welcome to the cold dead embrace of the sea

i have an awake amphibious expander
how are luck blood bond fire shield flags
garbage
atrocious
do not build around flags
kotc are a real sacred
exploding flags no fr bless
the image ive posted for you is the 100% correct build for marignon on this map
flags are really bad
actually hmm
maybe not
what would that bless even do jsoh
besides allow you to walk very very shitty flags into the ocean to die
march flags underwater where their fire shields don‚Äôt work
go in water is a good bless for marignon on this map
but only for kotc
not for friggin flags
they are all iron and it's shitty amphib isn't it
they'd get rolled by real uw
even oceania could do it
https://puu.sh/zdq6k/b3115fec26.jpg
it‚Äôs water breathing monkee
paladin bless.
not amphib
you dont
fucking make anything but paladins on that nation
poor amphib due to water breath
so -3 stat
is water breathing poor amphib?
plus rust
i think they definitely kill rlyeh with lances uw
i don‚Äôt think so
they kill like 5 lobos and die probalby
map move bless imo
does fire shield acutally not work under water
i‚Äôm 99% sure it‚Äôs just +1 enc
thats insanely sad
heat doesn't work either
awe works
that‚Äôs it
awe my lobos
fire weapons?
is anyone else getting "javascript error?!" on mod inspector r/n
i get that occasionally and just refresh and everything wokrs fine
i actually don't know how i'm going to expand. i may be a rump state due to having uttervast
but i am commited
how good is blood vengeance versus indies?
real sad that underwater bless mans cant make their sacreds who dont normally breath water in uw forts
its as good as how many times you can get hit without dying
so good on gisnts
giants
its been like this for me all day jsoh it is quite annoying
i am trying to see what sacreds shinu even has
ok how about this. solid sb uttervast
summons and shitty wizards
shinyuama sacreds are
tengus and dai oni and sorcerers
how does blood vengeance and luck interact
ok ty jsoh
and whatever stinky shity idiot mage you have
shamans
should i put some earth on the uttervast or will that make the ai cast stupid shit that is not leeching touch
3000 years old mage
i dont want him to throw rocks
that will result in throw rocks
as you well know
does luck mean bv doesn‚Äôt process?
fucked up
yeah its just shaman dai oni oni shugo and tengus
you will be lucky not to cast blink 800 times
s will make him jack off with buffs which i don't care about cause he already has the buffs built in so he wont do real dumb stuff
no i know the ai wont do that
once it's in melee it spams the shit out of leech touch
is fateweaving actually any use
ok
oh ty
they are pretty good about casting spells that go along with attack
no fateweaving is not
if you order them to attack
ill have to test
!details

if he does fists of iron sometimes i think im fine with it though
good bot
my floating mind tended to do bad touches on stuffi n melee
as long as he's not spamming blade wind to knock himself out like a moron
and then the nature stun spells when stuff was running away from him
did he take his turn
that mother fucker
lol
please stayyyy
i think it's probably sdn or seb
i will have to test and see what i like better
whats the earth for

blade wind and earth meld
is what it will cast i think
if it does idk maybe i can do sdb :getin:
arcane finesse, stygian skin, blood surge
and idk like +1 mr or some dumb shit
its real hard to resist building a pretender to cast the boat now
than kyou j brereton
of course i could just twist fate and +1mr for the same price
no i need finesse
im fucking rlyeh
hes saying fate weaving dude
oh
fate weaving is bad do not
fate weaving is bad
in that test if one side had twist fate they would probalby survive much more than 35% more
i think this is my god???
can someone tell me why anyone would ever cast olm conclave

just in time

high morale shortbows
short bows generally cannot swim
i can't attack him on land
or he will murder me
jbrereton: reanimators enthusiast.
i'm going with carrion dragon for sure
on theme
ok how about
chill/hard skin/ reanimators
for agartha
fluffed carrion dragon ftw
i don't think it can realistically die if you fluff it
soul slay
vs indies i mean
what do you mea by fluffed?
maybe to a really high roll of gryphons or pegasus
he means you send a h1 to cast the undead regen spell on it
you cast your national make undead regen spell at him with your prophet
or make an h1
so it has 200 hp and regen
sweet
yeah
mu i am big into reanimators ya
i'd do it with prophet so when your thing routes randomly it can always catch up to where the dragon wants to go
cause you want to buff and run away before you get killed by some random thing that walks by
how well does cold resist counteract being cold blooded
hahaha
-2 enc get fucked by the -10
it's fine though i ran cold3 agartha
sharts have cr and no cold blood
only your cap wizard is cold blood and all i generally had those doing was eq
i don't care if it's 210 fatigue or 200
what about in just cold 1
how bad is it
isn't c1 +4
that's still +4
i will have cold three of course
since the only thing that can go under water to lead shit is a ancient lord or whatever
cold 3 doesnt exist uw
cold one does
yeah
i will murder statue strategems if you attempt to trespass in my sea
if you kill ys i will probably not care though and share
actually, does blood vengeance pass back the damage received (after prot) or the damage dealt?
i have no idea how bv works now
doesnt really matter since it rerolls
all of the rolls
my god is alive nuclear monkee

it doesnt reroll. it rolls on top of hte other rolls
cold
i'm thinking cold o i can get over rivers
yes
it uses the previous roll, to roll
it rolls again then whatever

to the planet on the bototm right
40g researchers, lots of good thugs.
and then oh lol
that image is not the map
its very slightly different!
probably an earlier revision
the bottom left i think has a teleporter to anothrer moon
the top right cave planet has a set site of a great gold mine in one of its provinces
caves generally have shitty income that's probably fine
so cave planet isn't too poor
cave planet has very few provinces also
is ma abysia picked
they can be a cave faction and also completely fuck the game up

it is not

cannot believe nobody has thought of this

the idea of actually being able to play daoist space wizards was too powerful
bad news: the daoists are ea
you can still recruit the anywhere ones
those are buddhist reverends

now to decide how i should build my pretender
it's an enormous game with lots of provinces it should be entertaining
i recommend everyone take a amphibious god
who can kill indies

just do aby things, namely fuck the world with ac

aby god = b10s6 great warlock
pray you start in a cave with xibalba and ice them instantly
sounds more my speed
nobody is even xibalba
is anyone mict land
yes
what would i  want for scales?
is jotuns here so someone can <:illwinter:372894192894214176> the whole solar system
besides d3
and h3
you don't want d3
why would you want d3
??????????
thought that was their gimmick
no
half effect
it's not a bonus. it's a penalty
half income effect
that is in ill winter's mind their gimmick
growth is half as good
it still kills population the same
half as bad death is still terrible
but death is not viable on an old fucker faction
and makes your old ass hole guys age old as fuck super hard
ah
it kills/grows pop half as much i think
and yeah the pop grow still works
i thought it was income and supply or something
but more important, old, and you don't want death bad events
fair enough
if you have death it precludes misfortune
d1 is safe, but full on d3 lmao no
abysia wants turmoil 1 b/c it is basically no rec point faction
hot 3
magic 3
misfortune three growth three
nothing else matters really since you dont get as much income as your should from growth
and you dont make troops
doesn't the pop growth still work full effect
or is that half too i should check but i am very lazy
who knwos
i hate blood
i don't? just straight sacreds?
very much
your sacreds are bad too!
summons then
you summon cross breeds
you make troops to expand and try to get out of them as fast as you can
which are incredibly talented and good
unless they are the bad ones
and sometimes make troops to punch indies ya
so does the warlock go in jail?
whats the best flavor to banish and smite

its earth, right?
when you're 'lucky.'
it's death or maybe nature
uhh
air or astral banish
except vs like tarts or something
this game has strong human representation
yum.
and nature smite i think
proper late game abysian army https://i.imgur.com/arwmxo2.png
ok but since you can't pick based on those i would say overall death i think
vs just skeletons air or astral banish is sick
for best balance of pretty reasonable
isnt death banish tiny
no it's like 4
h3 astral banish is like aoe 15
the bad boys of maggotry
having trouble working out how to fit b10s6 on a great warlock
actually do any of uttervasts attacks work on skeletons
it doesn't look like they do
you do not actually go b10
they are all no work on lifeless, no work on mindless
b4 or 5 would suffice
i suppose exist and dr is enough
and astral you can take at like 4 or 5 also
with a couple points of earth to make a coin with
them sprites remind me of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbjvqb9wg98#t=25s
great moment in television.
lucky to have your country turning into a hell hole
nah mate just go the spar
tfw ur lucky enough to have your competition be evil
so i suppose bless doesn't really matter much
bc they bad
finesse is cool
the bless you want is arcane finesse and blood surge
far caster is probably good for uhh
' and now "crapita" '   is a good pretender name.
what is thier not warlock mage
far caster would also be good
fireballs shoot a long way already
demonbred?
doesn't that extend strat range too
yeah but the accuracy thing
can you get away with 4 candles in dom 5
you could put a shroud on a warlock and shoot horrors farther
monkee not afaik
50% combat range
that's fucked up
if it's a 2 prov bonus on the strat map
that would be insanely good
does shoot far affect aoe on tune spells
or does it just not do anything since they are range 0
no
how would that even work? other than prophet or shrouded units, nothing is blessed on the map
not true
being autoblessed is a thing , chayots have it
some blesses work while unblessed. like water breath
pg prophet shrouded all might have interesting things to cast, also spread dominion units
i know some things like half dead work, but it explicitly says so
ok, that makes more sense
and also theres holy water or shrouds to be belssed all the time
im gonna do it. im gonna make a 4 candle pretender.
and spending 5s for a shroud to add finesse is basically giving you another pen booster to forge
that's strong
empower your juggernauts in fire as abysia to cast fires from afar - powerful
4 candles is okay if you have h2+
if you do not then i would not advise
this look decentish?

also it means you will need to make a fair number of h2 to control dom, which is fort turns you will be committing
more misfortune imo
how the fuck are you going to do anything early
mis3 t1 flip sloth to prod
go dom like 4 and slam that prod up
i haven't the foggiest idea, hence asking for advice
you can blood sac later
dom5ish is fine
i do not have h2
h2h2 productions
huh, weird, that didn't capture the current setup anyway.  weird screenshot program
dom4 with no ability to preach or sac sounds like bad times
lpristi take the minor mr away, dip into turmoil 1, take prod
you can get from s4 to s6 with a hat and a coin
at constr 6
even if you are not going to make troops produ is beter than order now becuase order is less money
you don't even need an ac god at all a warlock with s3b3 can do it very easily with one empower and some boosters

if this game isn't running silt maybe go d3 also
or no misf3
a w a k e a z i
awe withering done
https://puu.sh/zdstu/fb0bde665c.jpg
does ma abysia get like a bonus fire point or is it just ea aby gets bonus and none of the others
they do if you're at least f4
how much bonus. cause cheap awe is pretty great
1
so you have to buy like uhhh f6?
yeah
also i seem to remember from dom4 that turm3 misf3 was asking for death, is that no longer the case?
its even worse
don't take t3m3
no more than order or turmoil 1 with mis3
that's what jsoh is pushing up there lol
azi solves all problems
actually with f6d5 azi awe stygian i bet your dumbass sacreds work
https://puu.sh/zdt1v/d6e6a836ed.jpg here take a boring god
d5 is 2 negative scales
the sacreds have lots of armor already idk what stygian skin does for them
it adds base prot which layers
their innate prot is zero
with invuln 10 my stupid sauro lizards have like 21 effective body prot
abysians would be even higher, and they berserk
though i guess that 3 prot is not going to do anything
makes slamanders die less too i guess
they arent sacred
the mage
so do you drop , growth ,or production
oh
to get stygian skin
you could flip to death luck
so you could do t3
you cannot do turmoil luck
azi hungers for stat
https://puu.sh/zdtbp/725d832134.jpg
seems bad but who know
that is, quite awful i think
much like your posting
cut off a point of prod, and a point of heat. death to three luck to three magic to two
hot power on the sacreds tho hey
who cares they just expand
and block later maybe
they iwll be sad trying to expand in winter withot hot 3 dom pushing
!details

i don't think they'd care they will have awe and a billion prot
holy crap you might actually get 20 people
you madman
minus one strength would not hurt much
@pankor god registration is open. upload your gods!!
im getting scared
should i close it
and they actually fit 3 to a square unlike stupid ass burning ones so attrition should be low
but then i have death 3, which was real bad for abysia not ten minutes ago
i was thinking about joining this game like 7 hrs ago when i went into work and there were still only 3 signups
it still is
you need to research blood feast asap
if you join as the 18th i think thats all the starts available
they dont fit 3 a square lol
cyrle do !create like i said
do they have bad formation too
yes
!create
y
!create y
i'll do it
lmao. so 2 to a square?
i guess better than nothing
fucking abysia
what#s the address?
oh actually i can redo the server
is the real answer not going d5 and having better scales?
so that w ecan get 7 ench slots
hold on
d5 is vampires
scales are for coward babby
scales are mostly for babies anyway
you get cool fucking events with those scales
and azi can burn fire elementals with fire breath
azi kills fucking everything
no one will rush you that's pretty much assured
hmm if you prophet a king of fire
and he has major minor fire resist bless and the earth fire resist bless azi might not kill him
if we have 18 players how many thrones
yeah he would have to sigh and use his pile of melee attacks
probably like, 9 + 6 + 3?
less l1 more l2 imo
8 5 4?
king of lames actually has 69 fire resist nice
nice
azi could also break my space ship so i would probably not bother you
because if i bumped on accident i lose
idk ask in main channel
dw, i'm sure i'll fuck something up before we get to that point
it's pretty hard to fuck up with that guy
its acutally super hard to even lose an azi
it has 18 prot so doesnt really die to ranged stuff
and it kills any melee things before they get near it
if you follow candles you will have a thing with like awe fear fourteen
that fires a plasma torch out of its mouth
and can erase like 2 squares in melee per turn
you can kind of do whatever you can go with a cheaper god to have better scales
!details bad

samooooooogggggggg
antlion or gold lion
i started laughing like a balloon letting out air
as i saw that
haha
thrones for pankor
are w okay with 8 5 4??
all of the thrones
all of them
that is all of them
all of them is 20/15/10

please use the mu throne mod tia
final answer?
test it and see if you like it
i assume the azi will expand np probably see how your sacreds can do
i'd guess like 2 turns worth and a dude should be able to expand with no losses
as a bonus if you put in 45 thrones cataclysm takes fucking ages
yes a slow hell world death is perfect
<@184675842432040960> what are the settings for pankor gonna be? besides all da thrones
80 throne points 35 to win or some shit
idk
im making them now
more like, default indie strength and multipliers?
its 7 globals, common events, some story,  cata 69,  21 to win, default indies, sites, gems, research, resources, etc
all story ! all story!!!!
in a game like this it should be all for sure
thrones 10 6 4
<@255835336083636234> okay its up. i jad t ochange the name to pankor system
the address?

looks good question mark
it'll go back to normal when people upload
rofl is he samogging turn 4
and/or i fix it
samog has a job or something
that is incredibly next level
lmao so
with cataclysm the horrors kind of just sometimes hang out in the destroyed throne probince
<@184675842432040960> max throne imo the map is insanely huge
after they win
the maps not that big for 20 players
335 provinces
but it is big relative to number of thrones
bias the thrones for more big ones
level 1 thrones are boring as shit
also true
i did!
10/10/10
this guy gets it
thrones are stupid the point of the game is spiteful eliminations
thrones add more effects and variety
wizards, dumb shit bless things etc
what the hell thrones rule. the bonus a fax from level iii thrones make the game really epic
someone immediately claiming the throne of gaia or of bones and everybody flipping out about random attacks on them
yes exactly
claiming throne of gaia is sublime in huge games
i lost 6 provinces to indies in my ma man game
does gaia keep sending attacks if it keeps changing hands? because that could be a really good thing for two players to do
you send a global message of "fuck you" and claim it
had 10pd in all locations
throne of the deeps or whatever
no i think it fires once and calms down
the one that does nothing but let you make krakens
!details

okay at least more fixed
also instantly causes poploss to every coastal province in the game
hell yes
the turn its claimed
i wanna have it list the players that signed up but have not uploaded
but cba
tonight
taking the misfortune throne for that sweet pearl income and having your 50 province empire immediately be wracked by that events
throne of war and bones and gaia and beasts
fuck the planet random attacks for everyone
or someone sneaking onto the throne of creation and spiraling out of control
it looks like you get horror makred for being on thrones
high-level thrones for the win.
pankor system is a go!! upload your gods!!
during cataclysm
not just randomly
what are the throne settings kreil
nice so just defending is a death sentence

wait no
one more
and also i never said that

10 level 3s
5 level 2s, no 1s because who cares
you thought wow funny joke and then you said "i did"
it's right up there in the chat
5 3s is enough for anyone
there are 20 players dude
there are 17 players
so far. it may actually fill
i suspect it will
someone else join as water please
at least 1
how many points did you make it to win
21
blackjack
21/37?
slightly over half
what about 0/10/10, 30 pints to win
it took until early spring of year 4
what about you take your fucking turn riddy
for the game to end
i took my turn cryle.
hours ago
you can do flat half to win it's a big map
or even less than half slightly
so thats what 4 and a hlaf years
of cataclysm
if the big map is well connected, which this one looks like it is
a lot of hell turns
if it starts on turn 5 that's a little less than 4 years isn't it
turn 5 of years 0
yes
oh im
i would also like to lobby for more bigger thrones and a lower throne point victory threshold
real dumb
yea still like 30+ turns of hell
its not a democracy
its also a big pain to change thrones if you already made the thing

whatever it's fine. as long as the settings aren't totally fucked it'll work

game will probably drag on to like turn 90 something
in absolute hell
so i got messages about hruvur agon kurgi and scabiel destroying thrones
umor the laziest horror
rarku too
get off the fucking couch
also they totally stick around in the province of the throne they took until they go someplace else to kill another throne
until they do that or horror desert
can people still join the game
now that its in pretender mode
please say no
cuz i think this map only has 18 start spots
if you enslave mind a horror during cataclysm does it stay
idk
you can test that yourself with some debug fun
probably safer to just soul slay anyways
they have really shitty effects for being in your province with your pile of throne defenders
people keep joining the donair cam voice channel
it would be hella cool if you mind control them and then they passively destroy the throne becuase they do that
they probably would
control them and they delete your throne
!details

they should make it so that units that get poisoned or on fire can't regenerate
<@170392794706214912> take your tunr (in the form of uploading your pretender)
but that would make poison good sometimes which is forbidden
noxious fumes is good in large battles

in that big cumshot battle where i send a hundred and fifty mages and like three hundred fifty eneimies died my mages had like 40 kills
it was all stink+wolfs + bugs
just kick anybody that do
the pythium way
anybody can connect to snek.earth directly
enormous stream of shitty garbage ftw
did you poison res your creeping dooms
i cast serpents blessing yeah
probably not late enough
powerful
!details

that's better
lot of games waiting on a last holdout
sad
the way of things
it's
i have joined the game
is that the wrong thing to do
also you can probably start the game and it only might crash with 18 start slots so long as every single other province isn't #nostart
sounds good

sorry, i would have stuck it out but i didn't really have a conceivable way to get ai ragha off my cap and i didn't feel like philandering 20 turns with no cap before someone decided to off me
i totally missed my pretender got "god of patience"
that's great
oh yeah, how the hell do command points work now?
poorly
no i am good
what is "crapita"
your posting
like, do you get more from adjacent provinces like prod?
gah.
no
every province has 1
jeremy corbyn is very fortunate to have my posting
but forts can add more
depending on forts
oh, but you can build over multiple turns?
default palisades give 1, then most upgraded levels give +1
yes
got it
no
yes.  please don't break all my guys legs
palisades give none
oh i guess its just the default level
was gonna say
only special cool gamer palisade give 1
you can't get to 3 unless you have citadels
i meant to say "you have 1 with a palisade"
or some other weird special case bullshit i'm sure someone will whip out
mictlan and ur get 1 point with their palisade
because ur is special and gets hella huge forts
and because mictlan is special and doesnt get to upgrade their palisades
and tax rates are gone?
and yomi gets just regular palisades and never gets a second command point eat shit yomi
weren't they gone in dom 4?
and replaced with admin
yeah tax rates been gone
admin always existed
!details

and that tells you how long since i've played
the fort from 3 red seconds gives 2 command points and also from wizard tower

i think it's at 13
how many ghosts do i need to kill 7 trolls and a kraken
now i need to decide if i'm going for major bless or minor blesses as ys
you should go for all of the blesses
current thought: shrug
i also need prod 3 because my sacreds are expensive as fuck
you just need a single hekateride atlanton
it's ys. you have one strategy: make your dumb sacred
yeah thats hilariously out of my current reach
do you actually need more nations or is that a sick joke?
do i need to give my hecktaride a sword or something?
the ys strat is actually cast haunted forest and defend your dominion with thousands of swans
i am super tempted to go for quickness
probably have to cast the animal berserk spell to get the swans to not run away
atlanton probably. with just hands theres a good. chance she routs to timer
pan also gets only palisades and east shit, except that they can make forts with a magic spell and also get half price labs and temples in forests
we genuinely need water nations
or else nuclearmonkee will have an easier than usual time waltzing to victory
yeah. yomi has awful research but they can natively cast wizard fort if they somehow can research it
*while building one researcher every two turns* someday my forts will come

thank you
but you might have an underwater start

the fuck are you talkin about
theres 14 start spots and 4 water starts in pankor
let no human wage war upon any other human
seek not to bar our way
for we shall win through no matter the cost
and pelagia is banned right
pelagia is banned if you are the kind of person who knows how to play pelagia
lol
i think thats a fair middle ground
i can't imagine it's hard
cryle are you "non human"  the sa poster
no
whomvever are you
permabanned poster 'cryle'
ownde
maybe ill pick a pretender with gift of water breathes
is that a real thing
how does that even work
is it like enlarge where its always on
yes
noice
i dont want to play oceania that looks dumb
*remakes pretender*
dont pick a water nation
fight a deathly scrap on land and go ai b4 you pick a water nation imo
gonna try and find that 'boil the ocean' mod that casts wrath of god but just underwater
who is better at expanding raven or dog
nvm its the linnomr
dragon w 3 heads, bird, or stupid dog.
just 1 head, but big farts
i picked dog in the game i hellwarred monkee and it was p good (for killing indies during turn 1-10)
i wish it was the three headed dog as opposed to other dog
<@181529528307417090> pretender "humans first" created
because earth magic gives protection whereas water gives lameness
water gives frost resist right?
v. tired.
helheim's throne (statistics -> thrones of ascension)
time to spend 500g on pd! woot! i love pd!

yeah i'm deciding between two builds right now
did we get an underwater?
ok uhh
i dont mean to alarm anyone, but i have received very strong instructions to absolutely limit the game size to 14+4 or else.
so the game is going to start as soon as we get a 14th land nation.  we are at 12.
is anyone actually winning on thrones?  
like are we expecting multiple magic teleportation armies to steal all the thrones for the win, or is it going the way of who-goes-ai last hellwar?
@pankor
or something
what
why
i launched pretender mode at 17, people kept joining. blame them.
that's fine but
what's wrong with 20?
l0ki says it fucks up the map really badly
the map is already gonna be fucked
because there's the wrong number of water nations
fine, i'm in
!details

oh thank god
apparently son of the sea is still a garbage expander
embrace chaos
let it go to 20
some people will die rapidly / go ai immediately anyway
yeah thats true
there's no way it's gonna be fair or balanced
okay
you have convinced me
fuck l0ki
does xibalba start n the water
based on my extensive testing of 'loading up a game as them' no
oh, what do the different colors of connections mean?
okay i will change to atlantis if we get 2 more land regs before midnight
this is all new and strange
what water nations are left?
atlantis, pelagia
oceania
also i think
oceania
ive never played a water nation, between the 3 of them which is most ftw and fun and cool and good
does ur want blood slavs
hm looks like not really
definitely atlantis i'd say
is oceania the one that is underwater pan?
though maybe ma pelagia is fun, they definitely have a dumb lategame thing they can go that breaks the game
i think yeah
okay well im not going to be pelagia with the caveat that i am not allowed to do the cool pelagia thing
oceania is probably cool too actually i dunno
oceania looks suspiciously like pangaea but with fins
blood doesn't work underwater
so that's one difference
they also can't swarm with their dryads
instead they just water elemental
why is the guy named atlanton
not playing a water nation
üá®üá≤ üîõ
yeah helheim just has built in thugs
yeah im going to switch to atlantis
mt
yeah ill just switch to atlantis now
taking one for the team
lol
trying to make a god i don't hate now
blood doesnt work underwater?
yikes
you can't blood hunt underwater

there should be shark mages who blood hunt underwater
silly gandjalf, that was one of my provs before the undead took it
sorry about the bump, gandjalf
there should be, but aren't.
also, jesus christ
that is terrifying
rivers which can freeze
or mountain passes which can thaw in heat

will you... not armageddon us
someone said "im gonna be pelagia and wish for more wishes" and everyone else made the reddit face, and now nobody can be pelagia
i will give you 1 guess as to why i want to play pelagia
yeah we already made monkee not be pelagia
okay but is the armageddon timer on atleast
im in 4 games and i've barely had any turns in 3 days, i've got the turn shakes. still, i dont think i can do a 5th unless it's temporary

do u guys think magic gems are really big or really small
i used to imagine them as, like, fist sized.  but now i think they're tiny.
wait wait wait
oceania is open
is anyone oceania?
nope
cryle uploaded a god and doesn't want to bother naksu to delete it
but
cryle fucked up hte game and wants to avoid having to fix it
i did bother naksu
why you trying to railroad me into atlantis then
naksu is asleep
we should just wait for naksu to delete atlantis
yeah if he wants to be oceania
i played oceania twice in dom4 and it was awesome
i invaded someone with nothing but sirens onec
so you're saying atlantis is the new shit
once*
on a gamble that he put 1 pd in every province
and it worked
has atlantis changed at all since like dom 3
i dont know, i just never played ma atlantis
they have really big mages
from any water province
like, better at water magic than the queens of water
their mages are beefy water mages
yeah their 2 cp mage feels like a str but hes not
why would i want beefy water mages
they communion
they can walk on land
they are beefy water+fire mages
and cast all the acid spells
so they have recruit anywhere acid rain
yeah but
i want to fuck with people using sirens
don't they also have lobsters?
yeah, they can thug and drop acid rain on people it's their one thing
i think that ea?
this game have any mods?
no
ma has lobsters
they can do really big falling frost too
ma atlantis has lobsters
war lobsters
imagine an elephant two sizes smaller and 0 prot.. but morale is fixed
and if the rider dies they become stupid
stupid dont hit themselves anymore
thats an atlantis buff
so be sure to only send 1 lobster at a time so they can't kill each other

beautiful day is ruined by a small worthless cock

it's open season on small cocks. girls hate them. ava is enjoying the sunny day relaxing poolside. she's unaware a pervert is underneath her lawn chair. suddenly, the pervert pushes his penis through an opening in the middle of the chair. she's shocked! not that a random dick is between her legs, but just how small it is. ava's treatment of the under sized penis is extremely cruel. she repeatedly yelled, get bigger, get harder, to the tiny cock. nothing happened! the small dick had one last chance at redemption, a chance to make up for being so utterly worthless to women. the small penis failed. the kind of load ava had wished for didn't cum to pass. even though her vagina was soaked with semen, it wasn't good enough. ava attacked the small dick, stroking it long after orgasm tormenting the super sensitive hea

you can also click on the province
you can replace the map image with a color-coded one by province type
at least that seems like it would work
bake me a cake bake me  cake bake cake cake  cake
its back up <@282646158218756116>
host keeps coming down today
if that game turned i means i possibly got to fight the jomons and send them to their fucked up anime afterlife
it did
jon joe is refusing to play ball and give in to my demands so i must kill all mans that exist
well you and boing's merciless bullying has ended bogarus
so maybe if you just bully jonjoe hard enough u win
he took a 14k pop province thats 16 move from my capital and his defense of this indefensible action is "its not your cap circle"
p fucked up
pythium cap circle is a circle drawn around all provinces within 16 map move of your house
ok fck it. im on pankor 3. the dessert planet. and it is. delicious.
ok, guess i don't need to care about you!
everyone mock cryle
p fucked up that im not ceding a 108 gold province for free
same
you get a nap and to keep your horsies !
ill show you horsies
i know what horsies look like silly
you never made any attempt to negotiate! you didnt even respond
b/c i'd rather just kill you obviously
you are incapable of killing me
i guess well find out
jonjoe i very politely ceded a more than 108 gold province to you for free!
that was in my cap circle
technicality
literally
this is also in my cap circle
incorrect
you also still have indies
i also ahve an army that was designed to kill twice as many horsies, with crossbow support
don't wastelands have increased site counts?
yes
good for you
you should all play nicely together
we may laugh now, but when he has twice the gem income, who will be laughing then?
<@!160127200803160064> did you come face me in honorable combat
me!
with the gems.
btw, what's the movement cost for uw?
or did the animes hide while i wander around taking land and stuff
1 tile always 1 tile never more than 1 tile
the animes killed my scout
at least it feels like that
v. rude
oh did he just patrol
ill just walk around then and take stuff
no
sometimes i've been able to go through water onto land
that was his pd
powerful
all *calculates* 60 points of it
lmao
i am defeated
our giants cannot defeat pd of that magnitude
attacking the homeland of anime is impossible
millions will die
thats why we needed the bomb
pankor 3 is the jungle planet not the dessert planet
i will surround them and devour their land until anime capital stands alone
though curiously all of the land is still held by indies so im not sure if i should clear his cap circle or not
a powerful strategy
not pictured: dying to having no gold income for a year
im willing to offer you one hundred gold, for the opportunity cost involved in taking my province by accident
do ask about things you can't find a counter for.  it's a brutal learning curve but learning is the important part
<@169456837236621312> what game
jsoh im not entertaining offers for the province while you still have indies
ok then im just going to take it
if you want to resolve this peacefully, that opportunity only comes if you take those two indies first
we are in a state of eternal peace
god bless our brave boys in brown
wait no
dont bless them nooooo
how do i beat pan???
*extremely illwinter voice* you dont
you cant
win the game instead
i was going to kill those indies but some jerk ruined it
i guess i will be forced to march endlessly towards that farm cluster and take all of those with my unstoppable armies
please post screenshots when said armies implode
ive never lost a battle in my life
!details pankor

is there a reason things don't line up
oh yeah
be real careful that you are going to the right province
or else you might go to the wrong province
i mean in the details thing
ithink this conflict will force me ot leave one of those indies alone as its ablative
<@177579426849095682> this is indeed the learning curve.  you'll kill me eventually, but getting bloodly along the way teaches you what to look out for next time
idk
i think this is the first time the map has actually received a playthough
with a full house
which particular bit of not lining up are you talking about <@378746941980278795> ?
if your screen is too narrow it just becomes 3 columns
that's probably it
i haven't figured out a better way
which is weird, because there's plenty of dead space
if i try monospace, then the names don't show properly
this way it looks great on web but doesn't really work at all on mobile
could you print rows then columns?
no, discord's embedded messages don't work like that
i _could_ calculate all the column sizes and pad it with spaces myself
but right now i can't be bothered
yeah, right now everything is off by a couple pixels or something
and i'm not convinced it'd work anyway
oh yeah there's also the vertical space which is a little overlapping
no idea about that, that one is all discord
really the best thing to do would be reimplement brainwrinkle, but that's a lot more work i'm guessing
i actually have no idea how to take on pan either
fuck brainwrinkle its useless and trash
yeah one of the reasons i did a discord bot was because i couldn't be arsed with any of that shit
i hate web dev
and it's not like my website would be better than discord is
any less bad i mean
green connections are roads right?
if so does that improve movement through water as well?
probably
roads are 4 move tiles
or, -2, to a minimum of 4? idk
https://image.ibb.co/jrikob/vhakisgood.jpg
greetings fellow residents of pankor 4
wow what are you doing on the dumbo planet
for lame uw nations
being dumb
and lame
not impressed with lots of these pretender names
i think i can be friends with shinuyama
and agartha
all caps nuclear weapons is also a friend
who is on sand planet
lets commiserate about how we'll b allis and conquer teh glaxy
!details
<@184675842432040960>: error: could not find the game
good. thats fine.
nobody is with you, yomi
both of the ways off of pankor four to the moon are blocked by thrones
damn, why oh why didnt i do 10/10 thrones
on the southern hemisphere at least
yomi should end agartha's civilization
if you're on one of the big planets you probably will be infighting for years anyways
incorrect
all big planet people will go ai
i will instantly lay waste to my enemies actually
i say this as someone not playing
so im an unbiased opinion
im excited to see who wins between pythium and nazca
i mean, all pythium has to do is make hydras, right? there is 0 counters to hydras from nazca
are they the adjacent start nations
depends on nazca bless
what bless would work
also you get one hydra per turn
anything involving fire. anything involving shock
yeah. so one turn now, attack on t2
you misspelled kerbal space program
i did not
my god is a collection of balls
harry on
you don't want to be friends with humans first?
no. my goal is to explore the solar system and conquer the moon
imo the map would be better if the background was connected to every other province in the game
desert planet owns
is it possible to start in the middle of the desert surrounded by other deserts
oh god the middle is highlands
don't think so, all starts are defined
condolences to desert planet inhabitants
are roads still in dom5
can you build roads over highlands
yes as map features
oh
no you can't build them because ???
lame
they should add a magic item auction alongside the mercenaries
mostly level 0 and 2 items
that'd be fucking sweet actually
only if i can throw my shit into the auction
that would also be cool
make more mercs that are a single badass dude
with sweet gear
imo
congratulations! after auction house fees you've made 3 gold for your wolf pelt
although now that i think about it i don't like player auctions as it could get crowded with junk
just trinkets and so forth alongside the mercenaries would be the sweet spot i think
dwarven hammer is const2
that's fair, but on the rare occasion it does come up could be interesting
and it's not game breaking if someone gets one cheapish
i think that'd be the only low level item i can think that'd be really bad
bot should not be spamming this much what the heck
whats better on a vanjarl
mace of eruption or stone bird
stone birb
why not have both tho
mace is cheaper
you know ain't nothin changed but my limp
theyre both 10 gems but i can use the air for better stuff i guess
what kind of idiot has a vanjarl and spends full cost on forging?
i have hammers as well
but hammer turns a 10 gem thing into an 8 gem thing and a 5/5 gem thing into a 4/4 gem thing right
yes
here is a screen shot of my preferred vanjarl gear https://i.imgur.com/r3enqiz.png
sometimes, to increase their effectiveness i will even put two in a square the same gear
that guy can kill many pd
but i bet a guy with a stone bird can kill infinity pd
if they have placed infinity pd you won
sauro is casting tattoo spell i dont know why
i have magic weapons
that is a compelling point
i am counting down to evo5 thau3
d10 demilch teleport shadow blast yes please
it is probably safer to just die and not cast returning isn't it
so i don't get lost in time and space. that seems like it would fuck me and kill my bless
it is one percent so obviously it would happen immediately
if you dont plan to retreat you can shadow blast like 3 more times

reasonable idea: dont site search at all, until you get conj6
siltymod game has no fuckin sites i swear to god
i have no gems so i guess its time to harvest every peasant in my land for blood now
i want my fucking turns
and i want them now
!details

hey why does it say im not submitted
i submitted
oh
submit turn
so in this game is it possible to reach province zero?
!details

will astral projection reveal sneakers
how do i get elf
you cant
i will get elf
get elf with the bane venom charm
elf can heal afflictions with a modicum of effort
supposedly no
ooh
thats a good idea
eyes of god reveals sneakers
why wouldnt astral projection
what if i intentionally get lost in space and end up there
can you use birds to patrol out elf
or shit, wolves
wolves are cheap
just get like, 80 of them
congratulations you've caught a province no one cares about
hey, that's a good idea.
related note, cryle, my offer is still on the table.
i remember a dom 3 game where you ruined my escape to the isolated province
you beat me the turn right before my fort went up
im ermor
i dont think i have a single point of n
which province was that
oh wait i remember something like that
some random map, it had no connections
surrounded by mountains
back when teleporting there actually worked
exactly
what did the fort going up matter
!details

i could summon dipossessed spirits. like, fifty of them.
rgrvet!!!!! reee!!!!!
or did i take the province?
it would have been very hard fo you to storm it
you took the province
it would have been very hard to storm it
for you
i was hoping you'd have some sweet stuff camped outside my isolated fort
then i could laugh and laugh until the game ended
i once found mount chaining in an isolated province
that was kinda neat
40% blood discount!
whoa
send horror is blood 9 now
and takes s5b4
doesnt this game have 50% blood discount site
yeah just don't cast it probably
kind of lame
i think dom 3 had a 60% site
which i've never found
gat dang
are you going to ever bother casting ac and taking the thrones
alrighty lets see some prophet names
oh, prophet names
i always forget
is 17 prot enough to fight zotz
opps forgot to rename
huge scrubs spotted
are kulullus strong?
'sgt anime pederast', not bad
they are like big fish guys
with spears
actually the province is like 10 income its not worth it to lose the resources
jebediah kerman ftw
oh baby a turn 2 event on my cap, lets see what it is
huh, none of my candles spread
i have 5 of them in my cap now
dang, pythium got a port city for his capital
i also had a turn 2 event, burned down the woods of the fairy court
holy shit new tur nnew turn
high priest. thats what i got.
3 air gems for a bunch of shit scales
lookit these shameful non-prophet-renamers
nothing like
i particularly like the ksp shoutout on rlyeh
forgetting to rename your prophet turn 1 of a video let's play
whoa you're lping this game?
i mocked myself relentlessly and will suicide my prophet asap
gonna try!
never done it before get excited for me to fuck it up
but yeah that's why it took me so long to do turn 1
don't worry, i'll be fucking up enough for everyone, i'm sure
i had some pride in my prophet name
!details

i also thought mine was p good
ya
we cool
ugh, nets
why did it have to be nets
so, obviously we keep a list of the non-renamers and all of the cool and good renamers nuke them into oblivion
did you turn 1 expand and lose your pretender
no, they're between my ponymans and where i want them to be
do i want to double expand...
only if you're gonna double expand into 2 thrones
!details

need more turns
im doin it. im doublr expanding.
further updates as events warrant.
sending thoughts  and prayers
ok offworld self-owning company is a good prophet
<@184675842432040960> i've done my part for more turns
https://i.imgur.com/ljgphnf.jpg
soon i will be in 5 games
and still the hunger persists
can big boy fire elementals kill vanjarls
i'd think so
lol at both of the ermor cucks picking divine emperor
and naming him basically the same thing
depends on the bless
lightning body
because aren't fire elementals aoe?
i want to know how the pythium/nazca battle shook out
my money is strongly on pythium
and fire shield
nazca is a rush nation but not a turn 1 invasion nation
if they have an awake combat pretender
and the other doesn't
oh yeah i guess
just recorded episode 1 of a dominions 5 video let's play
nazca probably has a stone hueha
oh cryle you fucked up
i hope everyone is prepared for me to be annoying
5 global slots
omg
i set it to 7
it probably scrolls
#restartgame
and only minor story events
link tia
:v
i'm not going to upload videos where people can see them without some kind of turn delay
because i would like to try to win
dude just write a diary
and upload it at the end of the game, or, maybe, like 10 turns behind
did you really put on only minor story events
it's easier to stammer into a microphone while you do your turn
make sure when you make the video
#restartgame
that you spend half an hour doing fucking nothing
each turn
im very good at that
i read the full intro text
#restartgame
and change the thrones to 0/10/10!
i uhh showed the map and then i said i worship a spaceship then i said my nation is bad and made some bad troops and hit end turn
hell yeah
ill guest star, where i spend 10 minutes talking about how agdq is feminizing gamers
i was like, "my god's name is a reference to chinese webnovels about daoist space wizards, note that we are playing daoist space wizard civilization on space map"
and then finish with "anyways, mystic, elephants, end turn."
perfect
also the audio quality must vary randomly between videos
and then because i did turns one and two at the same time, i could immediately say, "oh no i forgot to rename my prophet, gotta get him killed asap"
and resoultion should also be rolled on d100
today we play on 982 by 490
lol
i built sacreds
i also said i was gonna try to explain what dominions was and what the heck we're doing as i go, but that i wasn't gonna spend an hour talking about it before i started
and spent 20 minutes agonizing about where to attack
then i spent several minutes talking about it anyway
i usually just say if u are looking for a useful lp where you want to learn something you are in the wrong place
yeah i want to actually try
we are making these because they are the least bad. end turn
we'll see how long that lasts
the correct place is the niefel strat
the only strategy you need
i did the first two turns in 15 minutes-ish though
first turn was 15 minutes looking at the cool as fuck map
and 2nd turn was 3 minutes forty three seconds
i think i like just waved it around a little bit
i will probably have to do a more detailed tour eventually
i spent some time looking at the game settings and so forth
and then trollong cryle for messing some stuff up
"theres 20 players and some uhh thrones and stuff. anyways look at this cool fuckin cave planet!"
i like how there is a vast interplanetary trade network, with near instantaneous delivery, but it takes months to walk to your nearest neighbor so consequently you'll only see like half of the other nations
monkey i came very close to making my only bless explode on death so that i could roleplay cultivators better
speak for yourself friend
i have a spaceship
i will meet everyone
because they self destruct when they are owned
lol
meet new and interesting nations and abort their forts
the prime directive
note to self, finish 2nd fort before dormant gods awaken
well i am on planet shitlord otherwise known as pankor four
so you have to be there for me to troll you
at least early
is it really high move or teleport wherever?
i am on pankor 5
and will likely never leave it
map move 100 teleport
10 provs ignores all terrain
what dog is that
uttervast
you should go to the desert planet
rub in just how shitty their start is
it really is
fly to desert planet and blow up a fort because you know they had to save to buy it
it's even worse if some asshole teleports around knocking over forts
i assume it would be on the farm provs
assuming they can save enough money to buy the guys to defeat the heavy cav there
from my cap i can reach half of the desrt planet farm provs in one turn
with my spaceship
üëæ
oh there's gold mines there
desert planet is probably not that bad with those
the moving will suck but the money will be ok
and they will have gems everywhere
those water starts seem very imbalanced as well
you have your own planet
while on the big one one person is between the other two
desert planet has gold mines too?
i thought it was just cave planet
i guess i didnt look very hard
i tried to blind expand and my entire army + commander died to cavemans
the map is really epic frankly
are you abysia jsoh?
i think i called it weird and bad in my first turn, and i should probably clarify that i think it's awesome it's just also gonna turn into a hell
abysians probably don't lose to cavemans
if it was bakemonos or onis or zotz i would beat them
the middle water nation in the big planet does have a gungan tunnel through the planet
that's kinda neat
but they're still between two other water nations
yeah
but the most natural expansion seems like it would be to the empty bit of water
although we only have 3 water nations
moving around on this map is going to be actual hell
im amphibious
im just a million miles away from the water
you have the water moon
the forest moon of pankor
170 wins the award for most awkward start location
mostle because of that throne
still shitty even withououtut
it's not great but you have a huge amount of space behind chokepoints
cave planet is like 5 provinces it kind of isnt great
it would be good if iw as ea agartha
huh, desert planet has only 1 way in/out
no way not to fight other desert planet man
that planet isn't big enough for the two of them
i mean look at it the planet's total crap
to be fair once you win the whole thing is yours
still shitty but 3 thrones
super well defended
38 provinces too
lots of sites prolly
and i don't see anyone encroaching in anytime soon
given you kind have to straightline into it
apart from the spaceship
is a green connection like, forest survival?
is the ringworld forested?
isn't green roads?
this game sounds like a nightmare in the offing
oh cool roads
yeah
it's gonna be a hell dimension for sure
just remember two things and you'll be fine
number 1. you don't play ma ermor
number 2. you don't play ma ermor.
super marignon galaxy would be a good pg name
corollary: don't play in games with ma ermor
how much precision is eagle eyes?
4
heck yeah
which is usally 8
do they still do that
yes
if u think about it
trueshot longbow, is 60 precision! wow! value. no other item gives that much of a stat!
which is usually 8??
if this is something i knew i have forgotten it
if you have more than 10 precision every point counts for 2 points
huh
okay
every time someone says 'if you have more than 10 precision every point counts for 2 points' one of the bots should post grandpa jojo
i don't get it.

i think i might go ai for that
just suicide them asap
like the time in bloodbowl i accidentally spent all my money hiring a player with a default name and immediately fired them putting me on the back foot for the entire tournament
i told r'lyeh that he was going to get attacked by other people, and wasn't believed. i pm'ed him the wikipedia article on cassandra last turn, and as a result i'm now proud to say i'm being mindhunting for a good reason.
i don't believe you

!spell mind hunt
<@160127200803160064>: https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/?page=spell&spellq=mind%20hunt&showmodcmds=1&showmoddinginfo=1&showids=1

also to be fair "uw nations first on chopping block once easy indies have been mopped up" isn't exactly oracle material
also i only just noticed that mind hunt is a 4s spell, so those 3 dudes i drove insane last turn were probably mind lords at 420 gold each
yeah it's a really bad idea to just randomly cast it at fortresses.
to be fair
it's normally a safe bet with yomi that they won't have any astrals
but my luck means the augurs of rngjesus saw fit to gift me a 3s
it's odds on that someone has found some kind of astral indy, and all you're doing is taking out dirt cheap research mages.
deleting a super combatant: good move
deleting a 70g nobody: not so much
losing 3 4s mages for no gain: wired
!details

i've just padded the fortress with scouts until my astrals get there. have fun!
i guess if mindhunting continues to be a thing i'll just start empowering random dai onis with 1s
rlyeh was patrolling outside his fort so he saw me coming
why would you antagonise two people for no gain when a third is about to invade<:weebey:403422121466003456>
well, to be fair
in my case i just attacked him seemingly "out of the blue"
the mind hunts were in response to that

he's spreading attacks over undefendable territory, rather than concentrating them on the existential threat of therodos
i just don't get it
because they can't retaliate anyway?
<@255835336083636234> you should integrate the bot with a chrome app

it's probably just unlucky timing.

does wild hunt count as assasination
yep

decide to cast communion master

ok
thats epic
nice!
this turn a grand thaumaturge went
communion master
antimagic

let that be a lesson to you: dont have astral mages ever
if herne ever dies due to rolling mute or feebleminded im going to declare the results of this game invalid due to bugs

i'm just going in because he's there and it doesn't really cost me anything
i just happened to border him suddenly :v
;_;
its okay
they did what they were made to do
kill foul mages
they will be avenged by pupper squad, season 2
i went to cheap state school, got scholarships and graduated debt free
which is impressive in america
of course i'm lucky and could leave on parents for summer housing and so forth
do temp gen gens of the same type stack
my strategy was to not go to school
weve got 15/3
maybe 16/3?

oh, one of the unlearned
i went for one year and was given a job in silicon valley making 50k starting to work a linux computer machine and make very bad websites
in like 200
i would like to go back to school and finish actually but lmao at the cost
what was col like in sv in the year 2000
i lived in a friend's converted closet
guess i'll die
same, basically
it has always been terrible there
who the fuck
is that atlantis
it was a fucking joke though i knew basically nothing and built the worst shit imaginable
now i take things apart and put things back together that make idiots not die
get the fuck out of my land ye water sippin' namby pambies
making idiots not die has dubious societal value
i occupy a chair and collect a check while chatting about dominions five
don't see me pissing in the ocean

also he's an easier target now because i whacked on of his larger armies with free spawn
i periodically have to walk to and from the warehouse
yeah yesterday i had to walk around an industrial space for a while and i got pretty dirty
was pretty fucked up. i did not get to post at all while doing that!
luckily i don't get to dirty, just computer prep
some boxes get a little dirty
i actually prefer to work with the people at the plants. people in offices are the biggest goddamn babies on earth and you have to deal with politics and stuff
they recently fired the only stupid idiot i didn't like here
i show up here and people are complaining about rattling from an air duct overhead
in our perfectly climate controlled extremely nice multi million dollar less than 1 year old office. like jesus just put in a thing with maintenance and shut the fuck up
yesterday i was working with guys next to a wood veneer dryer to fix some stuff and it was like 125 degrees and filthy and no one bitched
we fixed it then we fucked off and had lunch and relaxed and were very non productive. that's how work should be
strange
my experience of industrial life is everyone bitches constantly
but only amongst ourselves
my experience with humans is that everyone bitches constantly
yeah you bitch about management and stuff
and the union
but like, no one bitched about it being hot or dirty
the number one thing i bitch about is sitting around waiting for work
different kind of bitching idk im just weird i guess
i love that ttime
im seriously nonstop about that
that's the time where you take dom5 turns
i spent almost 2 months last year sitting in a box doing nothing for 12 hours a day
with an hour paid travel also
sitting in a box doing nothing for 12 hours a day actually sounds pretty hellish
good reading time
basically corporations are bad
sounds fine (if i have access to a computer)
full communism now
etc
i had my phone
the part i can't deal with is other people
and invisible cities
and a bluetooth speaker
well jsoh works in mordor and the deprivation chamber doesnt have a computer machine i dont think
and a box of hot
pretty good when its night shift and its snowing or raining every other night

nevermore isn't keeping very coherent

nuclear monkey did you see herne killing a daeva with 28 gems
that's markov bots m8
the incoherence is a part of it, because sometimes they say something amusing
but goons are already good enough about being incoherent

because you're right, first order markov is kinda nonsense
although i still want to make a rnn.
put a cellphone activated bomb in the new one so you can set it off remotely if it gets stolen, instantly eviscerating the thief and/or their fence, imo
eh it's probably some poor homeless guy i dont think i care
and my bike was old. i will find another for 35 dollars on the internet probably
its true i fucked up
lmao at the bot triggering its random chance in every channel
that's not gonna get old

yeah i change my support to the nazca faction as well. eat shit pythium!

murder? drake abjures

i would kill her just for being queen
marry elsa, fuck the zoot rabbit, kill myself
jsoh confirmed trying to kill liz
i hope he's somewhere i can conquistador him
my phone service provider actually seriously just pushed an android update bundled witg a fucking under armour app
what in the world
i got two turns up
and im not taking them. im rationing my turns. im in control, not the turns
yeah stringing yourself along on a mantainence dose sounds like casual use and not abuse at all
ur hooked
you're having a night out at the club when suddenly this guy https://i.imgur.com/xs7ebgm.png
builds a temple on your gf's ass. what do?
no reinvig
throw skeletons at it
mind hunt isn't worth throwing at forts, for exactly the reason it failed on yomi: you never know what they have, and s4 (or even s2/s3 with boosters) are valuable
what you do is use it to kill commanders of armies, which you know have no s mages in
will of the fates would be helpful, too. since every hit would kill, your dudes would ignore 75% of hits
!details

could i please hae 48 hour turns for this game
black bow maybe?
horror mark a lot
life for a life a lot
is that a lot of wish for power?
and wish for magic
but yeah
pretty sure wish to kill that fucker would work
who's the generic commander with the best prec? because i do like black bow as an option
looks like spire horn seraph, 45g for 13prec and a1 for aim,
lol if your black bow carrier isn't a crone with 4 copper arms
mod bow of war to be like 40 arrows again imo
120 arrow crone
~10 spire horn seraphs with black bows (aim, fire), some lizard shaman (luck, curse, swarm), and as many harab seraphs to skelespam as you can fit.
what does feeblemind do to mr? does it take off a percent or a fixed amount?
tired: mind hunt
wired: teleporting magic duels
inspired: teleporting magic duels with no plans to retreat or return
5
and deletes their magic
yeah, but with only 25 mr soul slay & disintegrate seem feasible
the strat is i think "cast 900 skeletons and laugh" btw
oh yeah, he'll defnintely fatigue out
they've also gone berserk which is a real bad time for their enc which i'm not sure is even included in the 5 listed
x2 because quickness üòÉ
yeah, black bow doesn't solve issue, but him not having magic makes life easier
if you donate gold or air gems i can delete his stalling ass faster...
the.
thehe.
.het
what are your terms, i'm not giving away gold
although i have 83 sitting around at present
you give me gold, i buy overpowered sacreds. it's me and him in a thunderdome, so it's not like i'm bamboozling you. you want this guy sloooowing taking  his turns until late game, or you want to support bug squash the swift?
right, but what do i get if you succeed, and what do i get if you fail? i also have air gems
you get faster turns, and an ally, if i win. failure means tedium for us all.
i'm talking material benefits
i got some gems i aint using
what kind?
and if you do win you'll have the best cap in the game
1 fire a turn, 1 earth a turn, 1 death a turn and 1 astral a turn. all up for grabs!
gold or air gems accepted in exchange! everything must go!
i assure you, with my scales, i will not have a good cap
pyth cap generates like 8 gems a turn
that's what i was referring to
yeah pyth has best cap income in the game
i'll use them for good, instead of evil
isnt it all nature
or like, 2n3s or something
oh wow its 8 gems
you definitely seem over extended, but i think you needed to try blitzing when you did
otherwise i'd have had even more birbs
i wish you the best but i dont think nazca can kill a hydra
it's really easy though
first you start killing the hydra
then you finish
its too stinky
i have a province that in dom5 newbiegame that
has 28 cuyochis gathering freespawn
i get over 200 of the free shitty birb men per turn
i've also removed over 7000 population from the province over the last 15 turns or so <:pan:372896697317064705>
<@282646158218756116> look at this. the majesty of a newbie game
quickness, ironically, is better against skeles than you think. sure they fatigue faster, but they kill faster too
net result, need more skeles than you otherwise would
to fatigue them out
probably want to ping <@68614451045076992>, the host
aw man why tho
oh wait
c'moooon jonjoooeee
it's called more-turns for a reason
yeah since they have to dodge fewer hits
if you have trouble just submit partials and gain everyones ire
<@190292302785150976>
please
i have a life
i have things i'd rather do than spend an hour pondering this game each day
brain-genious: teleporting your astral empowered blood mages for a horror bomb
b/c that's how long it takes me
for this game, alone
also they can kill fast enough to actually gain ground towards the mages when the mages are on fatigue watch
hahaha
the hell
ok, i have 7 air gems
ok compromise
how about uhhh
32 hours
fine
can you start that now b/c i probably won't be able to put in a turn today
i actually spent time doing my entire turn already and couldn't finish it b/c my computer shat itself
losing all my progress
rip
tbh idk how to extend
i just set the timer higher
sounds fantastic
lets do it
set it higher then hit the reset button
also kremath what will you pay me to back off?
then check to make sure the server is still up after a minute or so and, if it's not, hit reset again
it's costing me a lot of gems to have you soul slay all my thugs
or "repair" i guess it's called
need more mages

tyvm
i have lots of gems
uhh

i'll give you my throne
it's at 74
i have 4 but you did nothing to say what you need them for
it's a start
lol
just saw the map
üòâ
and nothing you offered reeks of desperation
lol coalition they are both eating me
haha suck it losers i got burelk
he's gonna kill a bunch of barbarians for me
maybe
selling cauldrons of broth btw
20 nature gems or 15 death gems a pop
finally, your city will have a guard
all those militia all for you
sorry, that throne is closed for the oni job fair
what happen? you kill my scout.
i mean, sending your scout through the chokeneck of the world was probably a bad idea
i am a desperate loser, i'm not hiding it.
fight me less then!
how good is vengeful waters?
meh
how good is it if you have a lot of candles in enemy territory?
it's best at killing scouts but occasionally you get an important mage or troop commander
oh then it would be pretty good
also will it piss those neighbours off a lot
it would soon be your territory, i would hope
amount of pissed-offness probably depends on if there's a fort with your candles
anger waters is very strong on coasts and in the sea
and much less so away from those and rivers
you can't do sustain these kind of victories, <@96715337440952320>
*cant sustain
i definitely can't you're right
ok, how about for those 7 gems and 83 gold you give me 24 gems over the next several turns. you should be able to cast condors next turn, and hire a few more dudes. if you win you'll make that back easy with their cap and if you lose what do you care
but the alternative is "go ai really quite intact"
7 air
which i am also reluctant to do
going ai while winning is extremely alpha
for supproting evidence i point you to the work of greg "idra" fields
that's fair
<@185694323407454218>
get off my cap you perfidious scoundrel
no
i will be very cross <:burn:372895357962682380>
condor's a conj3
oh, my bad, don't know nazca
why do you need air then?
the idra gg would've been when i was sick at the weekend but on to win
for condors
this is more like a standard ragequit
but in a few turns
gotta build early
plz don't sack my cap
üò¶
up the gold, gotta buy researchers
all i have at moment
the only thing getting sacked here is the guy in charge of your capital's defence
for gross negligence
i dunno those 60~ patrolling bandits probably triggered an awful lot of gem use from your doomstack
it's the oni shugo
all yomi forts with 20 defence are a pain in the dick for this reason
how many gems did you spend?
yomi is a fucking shit nation vanilla, fyi
you know this
some?
i wish i was using your mod in this game
yeah but i'm not losing because of you i'm losing because i got really sick and threw away the best part of 1000 gems (literally) vs ur
i couldn't put a fort on the t3 throne because i had no money
ya rip
good luck
i can help with gems when you need them but i am spending down to single digits of gold
he bumped your nexus with thetis?
christ that must be a big thetis
no i think i pushed it off with stellar focus which was intended to block the slot from goh
which, lol
....
how do you knock an arcane nexus off with a stellar focus
is that , like, a 200 gem stellar focus? lol
the arcane nexus was cast about 2 over is the answer
and with 0 paths over
rip
this has been a very silly game but also very fun actually
gonna try and retain my dignity for one more turn.

decrepus!!!!!!!!!!
also that one other dude
did i lose anouther fucking army to 10 flame boys
no he's gonna die to nazca
flame boys are nasty
i'm sure of it
!!!
found a indy province that lets you recruit flame boys, which is neat
i guess i'm going to have to delete that player who never uploaded
that would be appreciated
also a way for game host to do so as well
or fuck it why not anyone
actually probably not anyone if you can secretly send commands
i'm gonna delete you
yes, if that's verified with an audit trail should be ok
then you could be blackballed for abusive behavior
currently it's only the user (or me accessing the db correctly)
users are tracked, but i have to go log diving to do so
so i'd only do it for something that actually breaks shit rather than just being annoying
isn't this just being annoying?

the lucky boys of etherealness cooly watch their army literally melt away before drifting off into the sunset
abyssia maintaining their strong 20:1 kdr
no problem, because its turn 3, and it should take like 30 seconds for the turn anyways. which means two people will still complete after you complete.
my sacreds are doing better in another game where i have quickness and ethereal on them

why does it say that one dude is not uploaded
is the bot just being a little weird. i thought we started with the full 20
not that i counted ofc
that's the map author who never uploaded / also i think we have 19
we have 15 land and 3 water i think
oh ok
i tried to start it with 20 randoms a few times in singleplayer and it wouldn't go
i could get it to but only if i put in 4 water 16 land
hm
the map author was also opposed to us breaking his beautiful map by putting extra dudes on it i think
i sort of paraphrased that

abyssia walks an army of 30 fire boys through five marveni armies, all too scared to do anything about it, knocks on the front door, says pigs re gay, and goes ai.
toll
nazca about to be insanely broken to shit i feel
although i think pythium might have quite good pd?
do they have gladiators? because that could be very useful for busting nazca pd
they absolutely do have glads yep
do not mix glads + hydrads though
nazcas starting army is those shitty human militia
pythiums, is what, heavy infantry with javelins behind light infantry with javelins?
light / medium light javelin guys
no shield on the centurion which means one stray arrow from the runa archers and it's gg
ma xibalba should have theft of the sun but the sun gets drowned and no more sun

what about the muslim ones?
how do you even play ma xibalba
they got too many commanders!!
i should make goast's name the exact same shade as the discord dark background
no they dont cryle
they only have a few bat commanders
oh, not in germany, no! it's a unatco killphrase.

yes, and you say "laputan machine" despite the fact that i am obviously not a machi--
<@120391130536738816>  fuck was that about
that bounce?
were i pythium in that scenario i would put four hundred gold into gladiators on turn one
then attack nazca on turn two
with everything
oh crap
right
you were attacking it
the thing i specifically said i was going to do yes
good one m8 lol
well
at least ermor is ai now
yes
agree 100%
at least i didn't dart any of your wierd horse mages
ah but would it beat... 400 gold of hatan runas and an aquispray...
yes i am nonplussed rather than heartbroken
üíî dart through the heart
what about totally unnecessary and pointless diplomancing
no there is no way you agree to disagree
it is a turn 1 rush
not sardukar terror troop back to back knife fight vs universe
buit how epic would that be
also can immobile pretenders patrol? itd be pretty high stakes if pythium threw everything and got rolled by a monolith or something
nazca and pythium shoud ally
twin empires
well that is weird
the replay on my side shows me winning the battle lol
they'd have to actually be around to do that

good luck

im not putting anyone ai until they miss 10% of their turns
which will be, he will have missed 50% in about 3 hours
missing a turn 3 is possible if they did not get the memo or something happens
with the crushing benefit that 4 d gems and 50 gold should give nazca it is altogether possible that they will win easily next turn

how is pythium nazca going
[8:30 pm] thewetfish: the events lists has changed again, including a bunch of "fuck you for having any misfortune" events
does the events guy know
i haven't even seen my turn yet
that drama is way more exciting
that everythings fucked up
maybe he has no idea.
there's an events guy?
ugh, nets
yes me and cryle should be on he same team
there are insanely too many negative events, overall
even at lot three i'm still seeing people losing one of their 15 provinces every other turn
[8:35 pm] thewetfish: there's an events guy?
yes, there's one guy who writes all the events
sounds good to me cryle
the dark vine commander event is fucking inexcusable
its entirely possible he just doesnt realize the implications of writing thousands and thousands of negative events.
i got an event in a game
where a vampire... joined me
<@68614451045076992> is your game up yet
it was a normal vampire that was a commander
and he had a fire resist ring and an axe of sharpness
smart
the disciple game?
the lobby is
you want ea ma or la?
i'm thinking ma or la
insane scenario where a vampire in the maternity ward ... seduces me?!

not really <@110869804197351424> they kicked aspho in the junk
hmm
it should be banned then, to keep it from fucking up the map.
can make a badass carrion dragon tho
sir you can't break those cuffs.
there is no coalition
there is only war
only reason i kill the monkies is because they try to kill me, i'm primarily concerned about nazca now
at least, now that jotun isn't sitting at 11 points
no!
no!!!!!
my double expand only had one succeed so now i cant go ai
and i certainly hope you should be concerned about the nazca solution, otherwise it wasn't much of a solution
is dark slumber new?
if i/we can put a dent in nazca the balance of power will be relatively even
but "putting a dent" means killing like 800 birds

a mage will just gladly cast fire elementals forever, right
im not gonna lie, that battel could have gone better for me.
is it time for u to go ai ridi
nah
vanheim has been fighting me in wrath of god for 5, 6 turns now. his army of 150 has to have been whittled down right
i dont know, because i dont know how much damage wog bolts do
i dont think glamour units get hit
but maybe they do
stealthy units do, why wouldnt glam
home team bias
oh right i was gonna cast eyes of god
thanks for the reminder
im going to get all the globals w the word 'god' in them and hopefully i get an exodia win
the real pro global with wog is foul air
hmm
damn thats a pretty good insane fuckhead enchantment
the real exodia is to have globals with 8 paths on them
buy my gems cryle
all my provinces have h1 scouts
wogs begin at province #6.
where is the map from anyway
please samog, no racial slurs
ridi im generating like 800 gold right now

hey have people tried using the nation gen mod for dom 5
i'm having issues
it'll create the nation
and then throw this error
error writing mod: .\mods\nationgen_eaten.dm (the system cannot find the path specified)
where eaten was the mod name for example
are you putting everything in the dom5 mods folder and not the dom4 one by accident or something
bc ive copy pasted mods there's not really any syntax difference
no i don't know where the mod actually goes
like "eaten" in this case
is dominions giving you that error or the nationgen
the way to find the place to put mods is you launch thr game go to the tools thing from the menu and hit open user data directory or some shit like that and put the mod in the mod folder
nation gen
i totally get how to use mods
i just can't find where the mods are actually being created
like i'll search for the name and it's nowhere
oh. idk then
im shitting rn i will look. or you can try to find elmokki
i'll try again tomorrow
too late for thinking
!details

does .\mods\ exist
does anything
i think that
you should probably learn patience
though it does suck on these first 3-5 turns
sometimes people are in full on hellwar and conducting different timezone diplomacy by turn 8
i was on 10/11 a few turns ago üò¢ now i'm down to 5
i hope not
'diplomacy'? what's that
<@114740794476331015> warned you about that throne bro, told you about old men
i still live
@cryle sneaky, i like it
did you take 3 misfortune irl
that would have absolutely caught me out
let me just bring in my own fliers for now, i can't really rely on your bad luck forever
still figuring out my team/nations
there used to be about 10 billion polypal spawn in kremaths cap so guess they've gone on a trip
your support is making this all possible, but the terror of pythium isn't over.
compose a short ad campaign in the "the children of nazca need your help this summer... little accla lost her house to pillaging gladiators etc. etc." style to solicit more donations imo
holy shit
this guy teleported his monolith into my throne defence pile
and first round decided to cast summon earthpower instead of equake to kill my hueg pile of mallquis
and then after that hes immediately stunlocked to death
holding 2 globals lol
oh i see
the guy also walked a army in
and probably just doesnt get how movement works
nice bless btw, i have half a dozen heroes now
ive no idea what my midgame is supposed to be though
https://puu.sh/zfijv/d932a6625b.jpg
he came
with a bag of wind lmao
misfortune 2= hero on turn 8 and a free hand deviliered 40 gem item
thats good, i went luck 3 and lost 16000 population to plague
number of zeroes is correct
on my cap where im making sacreds
https://puu.sh/zfipl/15cee4e53a.jpg lol
744 is a cool number lets see what happened
i feel guilty for roping everybody into an attack against nazca and then going ai, but im glad i bailed out of that game
the shard wights were on guard commander lmao
man agarthas are hella brave
<@275205678010859520> what bless is that
the one you came up with for tien chi
i do a lot of things i odnt remember
awe + air shield
and unaging i hope
yeah
luck is dogshit now imo
go misf3 on every nation
maybe misf2 i dunno
jsoh i also got a free vampire event
mine had an axe of sharpness and a fire ring
not as good as free air booster
ugh, ai sauromatia is beating me to death in theodoros game
how embarassing
just gimmie all ur stuff and go ai imo
how fucked up is it that j brereton went ai like 4 times without giving me all of his stuff a single time
p. fucked up
a single annointed killed 220 skeletons last battle
but there are so many ethereal skeletons
peep the 100+kills per oracle in the last image i posted
mostly skelemans and ghouls and soulless but still impressivish
7 4 4
wowza
its really annoying that my dumb mages cast raise dead in battle
because that makes soulless for 1 battle
and destroys the corpses
so i cant make map soulless with the corpses
i might i dunno i am trapped between you and ai sauromatia that i am losing to
who are you even
abysia
im just trying to take thrones not kill anybody
i think if you go ai theres only 3-4 players left
ai birdmans have mustered like a thousand birdmans to come terror me
so now i have to make a staff of storms i think
i destroyed my economy and research to slay hinnom but it has ruined me
yeah i have lost this and badnations already
but may win more turns
not a bad run of games
i am surprised i survived this long
how have you lost bad nations already its like turn 5
are you the guy who failed to expand with the redundant blessed bogarus
oh no i am the person you made feel bad for both picking a carp and having it die on turn 2
lmao
oh lol
does anyone want to trade my gems for gold i need gold so much im so poor
what gems you got
i lost my expansion party to barbarians but i just built another expansion party so its fine
even ma income isnt enough to make yomi not trash
i have, yomi cap gems
ok so like fed?
afed
doesnt fire kill yomis
no
why do they have f gems
am i thinking of lankas
they can be a heat faction
yes
you are thinking of lankas
ah.
every yomi demon hsa 5 fire resist
except maybe the cold ones
demons all look the same to me, a racist

i sent that guy with 10 equites
and he gets assassinated by a drake immediately after conquering a province.
you got owned

does cockatrice paralyze clouds check mr?
i just conquered the promised land before gath could take it, which is good imo
eyy

rip rlyeh
check the battle replay for me
are those 3 mind lords feebleminded
did you know tomb guards have fuckin
4 map move
gotta go fast
no
they died because my thug melia's made a line to the rear and fucked them up
superior roman armies can carry all of their eqipment for 16 move
alas
he's been hitting me with mind hunts though
nothing's gone through so far
seems weak
anyone want to sell me death gems?
!details

oh hey, almost a turn
i can't remember how many i have to hand rn but sure
hmm i wonder which nation is prob going to win
as an avid arcosephale player: research != winning
what do you need?
gold is probably the most pressinng thing
i can make a long term deal
anyway, yeah, i have death gems to spare
so name a price
i can trade you plenty of earth gems or astral
or just gold
how much do you want per gem? i don't really know the usual rates
mind hunts are soul slays, so it's a mr 12 test against death
given that many mages have mrs around 15-16, you really need a pen boost to kill many mages reliably
also if any of your ghosts are mindless (dunno if they are) they are immune
they aren't mindless, they're not even proper undead
therodos ghosts have regular human morale
but they do have good mr
no wonder the mind hunts are bouncing right off then
i dunno what the usual rate is for gems either tbh
what's the usual going rate for gems in gold
throne of bone is province #19
entirely situational and depending on which gem
sounds like foreverwar
death and ea
death gems are always valuable
but like, how valuable they are to certain gamers at certain times
fuck, the hail mary drive by failed.   guess it's time to see what the horrors do.
okay well put it this way
if i asked for 20 gold per gem when you were in need of death gems
under/over priced :v
under
so 40/gem is still good or still really underpriced?
under
say 1000 gold is like a turns disposable income
20 gems  gets you lots of cool stuff
not a penny less than 50 is what i say
right, i can see what you're saying
by definition if they're willing to buy gems gold is kind of not helping them
so gouge gouge away
<@170661706421370880> let's say 55 gold per gem and if you're still buying after 5 turns i'll knock it down to 45
regret luck scales so much right now, barely had any good events and also had at least one gutpunch bad roll
oh uh. nah
if you alchemise earth gems you get like 5 per
i was thinking 15g tops
theres no way i would pay 50 gold per gem!
ü§∑
a alchemist pretender with f10 gets 72 gold per fire gem , at alteration 5
more than happy to trade gems though
there isn't an objective metric  that can usefully inform the price though
normal going rate usually seems to be between 20-30
ie for that observation to be relevant the buyer would need to have that pretender
i'll take a look in a bit and see if theres anything i'm in need of
"everything is worth what the purchaser will pay for it" - leonard nimoy, rome total war loading screen
if somebody is willing to buy they have gold to spare, but if somebody is selling then they need the gold
remember summons don't need upkeep
conot sold 20 n gems to marverni  for 450 and he made a good bit of gold
conot do you have any conceivable use for the gems, invcluding alchemising?
or selling anywhere else
i mean i have use for them in various spells i cast and alchemitising them into other gems
its just i have a surplus because i'm making like
11 a turn
think of it like you're making 11/4 useful gems per turn
the person buying is getting the usefulness of 11 gems per turn
you can easily spend 11 a turn though
especially death
gemcoin is my new cryptocurrency and it can only go up up up!
if you could use bitcoins to summon packs of wolves or demons i would be more into this
i've started forging/summoning a lot of stuff on repeat per turn if i'm making a lot of the gem typem
its like stardew valley
like i'm making quickness boots and flame swords every turn
make items and flog them instead
go fast slash hard
ive already invested! i am not a sockpuppet of ramc with his arm rammed up my ass at all
i will deffo not take the money and run
melias suck but i have so many now i can just throw shit at them
decent thugs in groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk3yuxrmcac
steve ballmer gone right
btw ramc i think jsoh is coming to steal your level 3 throne in warcrimes
uhh
ive literally not moved off of my level 3 throne
plz no slander
well its because i dont have scouts there
it looked like you were moving to the throne but for all i know its 4 hurin taking mans provinces
or mari
i was just smashing temples with the good chinese mercenaries
did you see my bragging screenshots of me killing infinity shitty molemans
and shitty molemans in turn killing infinity shitty skelemans
and also me killing moleman god and dropping his globals because the guy teleported and expected his army to arrive at the same time
i did see
thats one way to learn
death to abysia

come to 156 with a million stargazers if you want an asskicking, boarboys
lol i lose a million stargazers to fatigue feedback. i wont miss them.
then everyone is happy
he didn't expect that.  the script had returning after the end of a bunch of earthquakes.
oh
i knew full well it was a hail mary, but figured it was worth a shot before the horrors turned up.
why would he cast earthpower then
instead of just an instant eq
could have killed some mallqui instead of getting stunlocked
i didn't expect the stunlocked part, and wanted to be sure i didn't fatigue out from eqs.
well its got 0 shock resist
and my guys bless faster tahn your guy casts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpxryaapuv8
let me rephrase, i thought i killed off your blessmans there, and that you might try to go after the retreating armies.
thats my blessmans factory!
welp
like i said, it was literally a last turn "fuck it" move, considering the horrors are turning up.
yeah why not use your large powerful army to try to defend yourself against the horrors
so you can keep your throne long enough to time out a win
dude, have you seen the throne score?    i'm betting on you or skelemans to win that roulette.
you know what guys who cast earthwuake a lot are good at? its killing skelemans and naked idiot human mages
also if kurgi attacks me im turbofucked
well, he talked to me in the first year, and you didn't.  i figured you were planning on attacking me, which is why this foreverwar happened to begin with.
foreverwar pales in comparison to the importance of horror defense squads tbh
a pile of sacred w1 mages is pretty fucking good at defending against horrors
i've not had much experience with horror combat, what sort of shit works on them?
magic damage with no resist works on all of them mostly kind of
so frozen heart is good
atlantis is attacking me but with a single commander and 3 spearman?
shock damage works on some of them but not all of them
so thudner weapons
kurgis spell list having lots of dumb shit in it works good against kurgi but if he just decides to turn 1 and turn 2 cast master enslave you lose
different stuff works against different doom horrors and you dont get ot pick which comes so r i p
the guys who attack thrones during cataclysm are agon kurgi scabiel and hruvur so you can look at them on te inspector and guess what kind of shit they will pull
if you manage to defend against one of them then next time your number comes up 2 come instead
oh man i just looked and scabiels main attack doesnt hit fliers lmao
what a piece of shit scabiel is i can kill him easily
and agons aoe attack doesnt hit skelemans
are horrors magic beings?
seems like they should be
yee
cool
the new battlefield sizes make me less good at judging how much spell range i need for things
agon is actually a piece of shit too
0 damage reversal 0 shock resist 73 hp
scabiel at least has a bunch of hp
its funny how much better kurgi is tho . 404 hp s10 7 damage reversal
sounds like you got bodied
agon has 3 forms doesn't he?
and gets crazier as he goes?
if he does its not listed on the mod inspector and ive never seen it when testing defending vs horrors
oh man i've qued up some stupid shit next turn. it's all going to backfire horribly and i'll go ai
hey so i had an invisible unit caught by patrollers. they have to have spirit sight right?
pls send me  your stuff first if so?
they're iron hail archers from caelum, but those guys don't have spirit sight. when i watch the battle it says they do. but on the dom 5 mod inspector and even in the battle description they don't.
what gives that to them?
bless?
turn being taken
no point going ai if you don't try and horribly destabilize the game as well
oh i'm thinking of the god eater one
they're sacred, but they had spirit sight before bless
fuck's sake, inkpot end in my cap circle
at least it's on the edge
inkpot?
is sprit sight one of the blesses that always works, blessed or not?
spreads disease
new tu nnew turne new turn

if i want to show puny man the power of ulmish engineering, which troop man do i make? shield man and flail man?
uh shields seem better vs infinite arrows coming at your head
yeah. i'll hold off on the flails until i see lots of shields on his side

every time i try to view a pankor battle it crashes
time to delete my downloads folder i guess
must be nice for your stupid blog if you have the same name as a comedian
sucks for us obscurely named foreigners though
yeah that seems off
just in pankor?
and does it crash if you view them locally?
spirit sight would be pretty fucking useful if it didnt work
useless
if it didnt work to patrol invisible mans
unless your sacreds were also prophets
misfortune 3
https://puu.sh/zfsip/add68d4c54.jpg
lmao
illwinter please
event system good
i also have misfortune three and i have received a gem event
and -5pd
take luck 2: instantly destroyed by vine men on capital
take misfortune 3: rolling in money, gems etc.
are you on a ringworld of a moon by chance
or*
oh wait
the dumpiest of dump stats
i think that was actually misfortune 2
since i got a event saying misfortune +3 after that
i just straight up dont remembver my pretender
misfortune +3 your tax harvests will be even better
in other news ive failed to expand 3 times
nice
but it doesnt matter since the game just gave me more gold than i would have gotten by expanding 3 times
i have a shitty corner start but i haven't fucked up yet
ok dude my start
im a dumb idiot water nation though so ill probalby end with like 12 prov y1 just because
is so fucking insanely shitty actually
like look ait it and think critically
you are in cave planet right
province 331 is full of skeletons
yes
331 is full of skeletons.
wasn't one of them static gold
lol
yeah
the static gold is full of cave mans
that's bad cave men are ten thousand more effective melee combatants than your guys
cave mans are not very good but they are very good at killing fire shield blessed agarthas
they have fire resist aaaa
im actually sending my god to expand this time because the indies i got are so fucking strong
it's crashing on downloading skymap or something
i just noticed the spot of land near me is all swamps
so i assume the battle background is missing
like just 5 swamps all connected
hell yes
i hope i get this heavy cav merc so i can expand
because heavy cav in a cave are better at fighting than my idiot mans
i guess i could make some just fuckin agartha heavy infantry
they're bad but yeah you can use your leftover res on infantry
i dont have any leftover res because i failed to expand 3 times
really all you have to do is get that gold province somehow
the cavemans were the only fuckin thing
that i could not have expanded into with my starting army
and search all of your land, to get more gold/silver mines
im pretty sure i could ahve taken the throne even
since its zotz and heavy infantry who dont have darkvision
depends on the wizards
the zotz would just self own and die
the cavemans are the only hard thing i dont know why my stubborn stupid ass had to go and get everything killed on them again
who looks at battles jeez
200 income province toh
i always look at battles before viewing the results
it adds a tinge of drama to the proceedings
oh my god the eldest cyclops cant see in the dark
haha
he has 6 defence
he will die to cave men
hes fighting pale ones
he will die to pale ones also
with 6 def
pale ones hit hard
he has 24 prot
and fire shield
and bodyguards
holy shit why is everything os bad on this nation
they have a long pierce weapon fire shield wont do too much
im not going to expand until i have statues ive decided
cavemans probably fucking kill statues too dont they
fuckkkkkk
i only view battles i lose
so i can yell at my pixels
exactly
yeah theres two custom skymaps
if they arent loading properly, well, i uploaded them and its sneks fault
jsoh summon ogres lmao
can ogres see in the dark
ogres and cave men are on equal footing and it scales doesn't it
no
what else scaling thing can you make that dark sees idk
cave mans can see in the dakr
earth elementals die to them
magma kids die to them
oh. fucking cave grubs
im not even joking
conj1 8 gems 5+ e1
your cyclops dude has high e right
i need to remake my god so he can craft dwarf hands and runesmashers tbh
19 acid damage per hit 18 morale 52 hp
so i guess it would be, dwarf hand, runesmasher, coin
cave grubs ftw
maggotry
cave grubs are really good
shame they require a cave
he starts in a cave
jsoh please provide screen shot once you are victorious with a cave grub based armies
you could manually download the map, that might fix it
ahh. a gold mine. let's build a fort here.

mari is god aspho is disciple
fyi
ok
we'll define all that when we get a channel and pin it
gunna have to ask naksu to make the server when we got the deets settled
also how do blesses work now in disciples?
i heard that the pretender god does not effect the disciple bless anymore?
so like what carries over in terms of scales/blesses ?
you heard wrong disciple gets bless exact same as god
oh ok
disciple is auto blessed in dominion same as god
i think i was thinking of national dom of the pretender nation affecting the disciple dom
aka lemuria/ermor/ryleh freespawn
it's the same dominion
dominion effects are inherited from god,
so there is no popkill cancer with aspho disciple
yeah but i think i remember in a patchnote that freespawn pretender does not equal freespawn disciple
hi <@303193134026981389> we're on the same planeeet
we can be such good friends
oh did they change that. well i tested and as aspho i had no freespawn under mari
amazing! where you at?
ah, a huge sharp blade.
what is the point of "arouse h unger"
do the ghouls attack or do you just, create some ghouls,. except far away
hmm
the ghouls do attack if you make on enemy prov
it's a bad remote atack like call of the wild/wind
dont cast it ever probably
lots of spells are straight up bad
fires from afar
huge gem cost, will kill maybe 5 dudes
situationally useful
if you cast it a couple times at a province with just a site searching human pg you will probably hit him and kill him
it's useless for general use
i'm north of you, the other side of the planet
all forests are mine, you may have the rest
some of the rest
i love  fires from afar
imagine if we still had gemgen items, then u could cast fires from afar from a jar
uh just make 15 fire spirits to get a free cast/turn
bing bong very simple
what are you talking about
flame spirits aren't gem generators
are they?
i think they aren't in non summod actually ya
you're on the forest planet, aren't you?
i think summod made them gen 1/turn
i will sometimes use hunger/call of the wind/wild to ping-take 1 pd provs
call of the winds can get you patrollers at least!

when does cataclysm start in capitalism
oh god its fucking
17 turns away

it was accidentally brilliant for ai
a nice smooth cigarette sounds good right now, doesn't it?

it feels like when i first started playing dom people had throne point settings where you could totally sneak a midgame win
but now do not

so a disciple game huh
kinda fucked up that asphodel without its dominion is basically pangaea
they dont have seduction which is a very big deal
they also dont have any blood
i mean they‚Äôre still absurd
üíÄ
can't look @ the turn until tomorrow.
how do disciple games work anyway
i know the basics but
what do you want to know
the correct asnwer would be "very carefully" or "poorly"
one gamer is the pretender for the team, their pretender must be base dominion 3 or 4. it determines the bless and scales of all the members of the team
and also when all of the disciples become active
no one is allowed to make a prophet but disciples and pretenders autobless everything on their side of the battle every turn (i havent tested if disciples autobless outside dominion like pretenders do (i also havent tested if thats fixed yet since its a bug))
also all disciples are allowed to claim thrones
disciples become active i think in half of the time pretenders do
so awake=awake dormant=6 monthsish imprisoned a year and a half
oh, so disciples is just like, team mode almost?
disciples have to be dom 1 or 2 and disciples dont get ot pick anything except chassis and paths
yeah
neat
then in game you can use eachothers labs for to do wizardy things i think
and you can do a special order to give a province to your ally
(if you both have a commander there)
i presume you can have armies on the same provinces and other things like that
and dominion score is shared obviously
yeah
the game attempts to caluclate whos army is stronger for who will siege a fort or defend ap rovince first
it seems semi-fun, but i'm already in more games then the dominions mp ui can hold so
!details
how many games can the dominions mp ui hold

hello fiends
8
i'm actually only in 7 rn but the way it shifts off old games means that that blitz we played ages ago is still sitting there while actual games i actually play get bumped off
and theres no way to delete entries
its hecadumb
eventually it will bump off
yeah
after a turn of playing your active games
im pretty sure you put your cursor on the gam
and press delete
oh
neat

smol hydra is sometimes useful if you need massed poison cloud
don't make big hydra

just u <@378746941980278795>
does the stone bird get affected by weapon blesses?
i know in dom 3 hydras were mostly a trap
everyone attack warbeard he's samogging
stone bird does
and does it trigger the bless 4 times? or does it only happen once
yep, couple hours
!details

man i might record two episodes today
yikes
taught myself basic video editing today though
<@170392794706214912> in what context? in terms of ma agartha's golem dominion it's both lifeless & mindless
shake weight has competition for most suggestive work out equipment

every hit triggers the weapon bless
*squat magic*
i imagine that small non sacred hydras could be useful if you body ethereal them a bunch
still weak to fire

does anyone know if nazca beat pythium or vice versa
no clue
also what nerd started in 53
also, i got a random event guys. 1 nature gem.
i got 3 nature gems last turn
god damn pythium's cap circle is raelly bad lol

friendly fire yourself with the shrink spell
wait is trample damage now based on size differential?
wasn't in dom 4, you either did quite a lot of damage or you attacked

heat death pop unrest
ah well there we go
event 346
good detective work
is that one limited to one per turn per province like the other heat spells or can you just delete someonse capital
i dunno but i might play abysia next
ive never played abysia
are they still 100% toothless against anyone who casts the 'resist fire' spell
no
its not limited
so you can just delete 50% of someones cap as soon as you hit alt 5
nice.
err alt 6
if you have a bunc hof ummm
annointed of rhaux
its 10% popkill
i have created a mathematical model of this strategy

assuming the 10% popkill is calculated sequentially.
it is
seems like bvc are more efficient
same gem cost but you can reuse them!
and you dont need a f4 mage to do it
but you can patrol them out
although do your cap mages still pick up bvcs from battles and disease themselves
i think so yeah

:sad:
oh do casters always self-maim now
20pd is the limit from where a mage will decide its a big enough army to spend gems on?
i think its because yomi gets a mage at 20 pd and mages are treated as more threatening by the gem ai right?
i lost a game üò•
game loser
i was pan and got bogged down in quadbless mixtlan
yomi gets a 3 path mage on their fort at 20 pd ya
ideally i want to roll up pythium wnd nasca both but i probably won't be that lucky
plus quite a lot of soldiers so it's spend gems time
casters do not always self maim but if you go over 200 fatigue (very very possible with buffs like like after death plus even just 2 gem stuff in drain) you can get afflictions very easy
this is problematic for a bunch of factions with death / air mages but human hp
can you still do the thing where you cast life after death and suicide pact a bunch of your own priests to get undead priests
that will own in the game where im la ctis
sweet, tropico 6 is due this year.
fuck why am i always the main threat
yes but most nations cannot create more undead with undead priests
unless they are specifically tagged to reanimate
so for example ea tc in the ea tc game i'm in, soulless are just sort of useful for having quite okay hp as communion slaves
we call that 'losing the race in the garage'
but they cannot make more longdead/ghouls etc.
if you're la ctis i think you might be in luck

well the game ended right
so everyone has graphs
a 0 pop province shouldnt be able to maintain a dominion
you can be worshipped by ghosts and skeletons.
yeah but if theres noncombatabt undead they should have freedom of religious expression and also pay taxes
undead don't need gold, they don't eat food or require material possessions
lemuria is a communist utopia
anyway, cryle, i hope that you got everything you wanted out of the game
you didn't get a win, of course, but you sure as fuck managed to insult me behind my back a shitload and preserve how much of a piece of shit you are for me to see
a man who casts eye of god and doesnt reveal graphs
is probably winning i guess
or extremely lazy about screenshots
he should sell the graphs for gems and money
i'm lazy about screenshots these days personally

dont do it to me though im your friend. im protecting u from rpedatory ghosts and gigantes
it's just become second habit now to leave a group of dudes at the rear when i'm fighting caelum
since they all do attack rear
dont need to worry about attack rear if all your commanders are scripted to attack closest
jbre are you lping this game
i know you do that sometimes
it's a bit more deadly now, since they can hit rear-ish units instead of consistently the rearmost

it's cool that japanese polearms are better than chinese ones for some reason
they are malnourished and only have 9hp to compensate

and probably fear wolves or panic spam
i will instead take possession of his entire cap circle
the yari: somehow deserving of +1 to attack even though glaives, pikes and spears are not. no defense penalty either, 1 more damage than spear (plus two-handed), 1 less than pike, length 4
good polearm
those jap(ane)s(e) know their business
i will never do that to you
plot twist: jomonese have 9 hp because they're all women pretending to be men to join the army

mulan is def. chinese

this is apparently *a thing* now
i get an adequate amount of hitler talk in this very channel
i wonder who could have been exposed to this apparently newly created bot
that pretty much eliminates anyone outside of this discord right?
maybe it's contagious, the bot was infected now some of us may become nazias
nazism is a class of lycanthropy isn't it?

wow whys the robot trolling me
that is my feeling
i just gave it a restart

all good
now i need to stop it pinging people.
i have been pinged with that nazi message from another server bot, i think from clockwork hounds
.tag boing poland 1939
does the target server for the nazi discord still exist becuase i dont think discord is nazi friendly
which is great because presumably that means they have had some success recruiting a gamer reich
which is inherently amusing to me
like, accept the invite and report the server as actively subverting other peoples robots to evangelize naziism and im pretty sure discord would shut them down
i think it doesnt send invites to anyone who can kick the robot from the server so i havent gotten any : |
i didnt get any either
it mercifully only messaged people who were online at the time i think
do we still use brain wrinkle
at times
for ea games that have underwaters banned i would use it
which incidentally is all the ea games i would ever set up
im extremely eternally online
i dont think a robot or anyone but me or maybe samog could even see the full userlist
because discord in ints infinite wisdom has prevented this
how am i supposed to figure out if there are any games open

this records so good
hmm, does listening to vinyl still make you a hipster or does it just make you old now
i've lost track
im not old or a hipster i just say record
i down loaded it from the internet as a collection of mp3s
then it's not a record!!!
yes it is!
at best its an album!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital_recording
do you know the etymology of that usage of the world album? it would be the book you stored the various very short portions of a recorded symphony
in
the fact that it's a recording does not mean anyone would call a song or a collection of songs a record unless it was on, for example, a vinyl record :colbert:
thats wrong , very obviously
since i just did !\
i mean, i'd already discounted you as a person in general
.tag conot medium prescriptivist
a collection of songs or even one song so long as it is recorded is a record, very simple
from an absolute point of view, sure, from a common usage point of view, no.
hey that one was almost coherent
where do people not describe a new release of songs as a "record"
like "the new taylor swift record" or whatever is very normal words to say on a musical radio station here
this record owns
its so good i always think its almost over because how could it be so good and only be half over
a major influencing factor on me calling this a record, is it was released by the record label "quoteunquoterecords"
taylor swift album 100% of the time
maybe this is a regionalism though
what region
uk in my case.
wtf
i am a uker
and would say "record" for most things

<@255835336083636234> did you figure out how to keep your bot from turning nazi
the trick is not to put your password on the internet
give us the turn mugs
i bow to your wisdom, great master
i mean this kind of thing is literally my job
what is your actual job
scala
i write server applications very much like this one - take commands, talk to a db, etc etc
sounds useful but also horrible
much like your posting
i honestly love programming
hence why i also do it as a hobby
please teach your robot to recognize the correct context for "much like your posting" and "very carefully"
that's more the realm of boing's bot
yes
i also love programming but nobody ever taught me software engineering principles so my code is probably really bad
much like your posting
the context for 'very carefully' is quite easy but that one is harder
"is ... shit/bad"
also it would be very important to have the robots response be delayed, to that
the effects on channel morale would be disasterous if it was impossible for humans to use the ancient forms for burns
it would have to recognise when it has been beaten to the punch
boing if you're serious i recommend one of these: https://www.amazon.co.uk/pragmatic-programmer-andrew-hunt/dp/020161622x
programmers also get paid way too much right now
and probably for at least the next 15 years before current middle schoolers catch up and bloat the market
nah
note to others: that book assumes you already know how to write code (badly) and isn't suitable for complete beginners
googles gunna teach a robot to write code and obsolete everyone
we'll see
fully automated global poverty
i mean we're on our way yeah
holding out for robotic ceos
i have made the dubious decision of specialising in machine learning and robotics, and then staying in academia where nobody will pay you for it
but coal miners still exist, so i assume programmers have a while yet
yeah ml people get paid more than regular old programmers for sure
easy enough to move out of academia
(as i discovered for myself halfway through my phd)
a wise choice
i should maybe have... a career
yeah i don't even slightly regret it
that book looks good, i may read it

hot and sour
the best thing about the discord app for phones is that it just doesn't give a fuck if you told it to mute a channel sometimes
the discord app for phones also doesnt know when i've read a private message and will keep telling me to read it, constantly
try ?stone.
also sometimes if you get @ed it just doesn't bother ever clearing the notification for that
ask samog what it was imo.
<+skybot> stone soup, the famous soup where you strain out all the vegetables that these assholes keep throwing in, so that they don't distract from the stone
that is the quote yes.
that happens in my experiecne when you get a notification on your phone
hot and sour soup is easy to make, just put some hot and some sour in a soup

the mountains at the top of the world i'm not are really grubby in terms of what is even a province
but other than that not too bad
don't give up jbre, you can always suicide prophet and redeem yourself in 6 months
nah i'm kinda burnt out on dominions atm and playing shinuyama for the next month and a half until i die does not sound particularly fun
ok!
where are you so i know where easy pickings are
i forgot and deleted the game out my list
can you at least find a sub
https://i.imgur.com/0t3ppdl.png
no i'm very mediocre expansion shinu without enough stuff to be assed with not going ai, there is not exactly a springboard for someone to do anything interesting with that
like what's the problem with me just goin ai i don't get it here
not going to lie, my corner of the map is probably going to be ai pythium and nazca pretty soon
lol the walgreets photo
and oceania
.ruby
rip smerdyakov
murdered by the kgb
alternatively lots of vodka
pankor sores
so comparing the two-handed flail to the battle axe. i probably want the two-handed flail to kill weak protection stuff and the battleaxe to kill armored stuff, right?
everybody loves a shield
!details blanaced_team

the shield thing is important i guess, but the damage difference is big.
and things with shields also have armor a lot of the times
!details

well to begin with you dont want either of those if you're just killing chaff/pd
for killing enemy thugs ive no idea id have to look at weapons
but probably some an thing or the chest wound axe thing
i'm just thinking about which variety of ulm to make for expansion
and fighting later on
i almost feel like the pike dudes are worth expanding with, just because there usually aren't too many indy xbows
omg hes talking about pankor
maybe
ok well
im just gonna tell you right here, right now, there are in fact a lot of indie xbows on your planet
i haven't even found another player fucker yet
so either i'm alone or my battle buddy is expanding horribly
what do i do if i have more money than i can spend
diplomacyy
give to me
give it to me
im killing you
you stole it from me so its only fair
see
this man is robbing me
what's happening to oceania?
(and ai man)
!details

dark skies is a hilariously dumb spell.
i was attacked by militia with 0 morale and leaders with 3 morale
they really want to go home to their families.
who is arco in pankor
and can someone please kill him
<:prism:372894359680712727>
man isn't going ai and if nazca and pythium both go ai that's good news for oceania who is right there
i think only pyth is probably the one who will ai
and that super nazcar will occur
you'll want to make the shield dudes with the hammer i think (they have the highest defense)
doesn't matter what the enemy has because ulm armor defeats indies so it's fine
and the high prot/defence means you have to ferry less/have more land taking armies
i thought the hammer dudes were trash, but i didn't look at defense
but everything changed when the fire nation attacked
as long as you have enough dudes to make a line so they won't get surrounded
i just imagine them with a ballpin hammer
lol
yeah the hammer has the least -defense bonus for ulm
sadly they have no swords
unless oceania stops him
<@264039348494794754> is our only hope
or something
morningstar is -2 and hammer is -1
i wonder how pike dudes compare to them in melee
like how much the shitty defense is mitigated by repel
repel is a fucky mechanic
and i don't rely on it
lol
unless it's against poison spikey skin
ahhh it seems like poor man's awe
pretty much
i've tried squads of both, by the time it takes for half of my pikedudes to die, i'll have lost none or like 3 shield dudes
and all it takes is like 1 heavy cav or berserk attack to wipe them all out
which is why having a shield is good
yeah. that makes sense
and ulm troops really aren't about killing as much as they are about not getting killed
so later on, the shields make more sense
yea
and then if i really need something to kill something fat and armored, i could make the axe dudes
also hammer does the most damage lol
also i'm talking abt ma ulm oops
you talking abt ea?
no ma
do they have axe dudes??
two-handers
they have mauls and halberds
and even then, i'd probably be using the guardian dudes, because most fat things will be gods or sacreds
yeah
it's funny how there was a good godkiller nation called ma ulm and then illwinter decided that they needed another far shittier one, so they made mekone
black knights would be better troops vs thugs etc
or thugging out your heretic commander
63 resources !
oh yeah. he's cool
and 1 commander point
you have infinite resources, you're ulm
your basic bitch researcher has +resource on it
i love how the master smith is my basic bitch researcher
because he's also chad battlemagic wizman
true
i just call anything that only has 2 commander points a basic bitch researcher
which is neat for c'tis because they are also your battlemages
i was just gonna say: sauromancers are not basic bitches

the only one thats important is londo
but they didnt nuke tokyo
"complete list of mini-superlambananas" is an insanely good pretender name.
jsoh in response for the blitz, the uk created the carry on series which is a kind of anime
lambananas
a fate worse than anime
on a serious note i did grab absolutely any pretext because i want this game wrapped up, one way or the other.  not sure i'd join a game again with this sort of throne setup and no cataclysm
my girlfriend is german and we have arguments about who bombed each other more in the war
well boing its all your fault in the end either way
"my girlfriend is german and we have arguments"  another extremely good pretender name in the alternate dimension that has longer pretender names.

cadmus which one of us is going to take out that throne
i can get there in 2 turns
the movie thats basically borat but hitler
and i don't really care if you attack man instead so long as we actually agree what's going on and it happens this time
no
full disclosure. i've got iron angels now. so ermor is dying within the next few turns
iguarunteeit.gif
yes but i am completely burnt out on dominions and i just want to kill ermor you see
der ist wieder da
yes they will be killed and rekilled
no rekilled is the problem we had where they didn't die 14 turns ago
you see my literal aim is "delete them off the map"
not "agree to do x or y and then have some events occur that lead to some stupid fucking skirmish and ermor not being dead"
i am marching an army right onto their cap, smashing through the last army they have
their cap is dead
hahaha holy shit making this sounds like it would have been gutsy
do you mean that throne
wait not cap their last fort
right okay
how long are talking here
i wanna see it
because i have an army that can break the fort there in 2
and 1 of them is happening this turn
like, at most two turns. if i get across the river, 1.
and i'll be jumping in an iron angel on the next turn
everyone will enjoy my iron. enjoyment is mandatory.

<@!148098869782118401> stalling is annoying to workout because the game doesn't tell you. you can only list people that hadn't submitted 1 min before the timer if it went full duration or something

although i suspect it might be
if a ponyman cloud trapezes into a friendly province, does he participate in a defensive battle over that province or does he sneak himself

if i recall correctly, magic duel is one of the few non-open rolls in the game, too. which means sufficiently high astral pretenders are flat out immune to s1 magic duels. i think 6+ is immunity.

i've actually not played starsector in ages, i got really tired of the bump in the road that was the midgame point where your fleet is just big enough to get blapped by the super huge fleets, but too big to chase after pirates
i'll probably pick up the new patch and mess about with the scenario battles again though, even though not much changes in those.

there's a huge amount of new mod content and the sensor game as been tightened up considerably, which helps throughout the game but in particular with dodging super huge fleets or ambushing fleets that are otherwise too fast to catch.  also interdiction pulse is a thing now

who are awesome
enlarged golem dominion collosal fetish <:weebey:403422121466003456>
why do u think they died in the mountain
i don't think it's a bug so much as a stupid oversight
no mountain survival
spartoi *are* animated statues
so they should benefit
do battle summons benefit?
though knowing illwinter, agartha dom probably only applies to certain things tagged with #golem or the like
you have got the wrong end of the stick wrt illwinter
it's magic lifeless
idk if manikin work are those magic lifeless undead
ulm will bid like 400 and win them

so you get fun + weird interactions
how much does it matter to you
which people try to take out of the game

mate it gives bonus hp to the undead hero guy innit
agarthan undead are ghosts living in statues
manakins do not appear to benefit
there'sno undead hero guy
or at least not carrion lords
the onyx oracle is not undead
nor is golog, btw
so instead of checking for lifeless and magic, it probably just checks for lifeless and not undead
i'm guessing it checks for lifeless and magic but not undead
which means the extremely legit strategy of wishing for an ophan would give them a lot of hp
i'd rather not die tia

üëë doesnt seem to work either

illwinter would have done lots more for me if i hadn't already killed xibalba by the time i cast it
hey uh i know it's a pain in the ass but any chance we could get a slightly longer timer on this game? between mid-game blood micro and the fact i am excited about / let's-playing pankor, i find myself struggling to care, at all, about this one
either that or i guess i could try to find someone so sub into ma abysia under burden of time lol
but this game is diplomatically interesting, so as we're probably into the complicated turns now i'd really prefer a longer timer
aw man it's the greeks!
prepare yourself
i'm really digging monks
25g for a stealthy h1 with a bit of leadership
don't forget divine research
also recruit anywhere with temple
it's turn 10 and i've only got three provinces, but nazca invictus!
their research isn't affected by magic scales which makes them a bit less appealing
you got their cap?
jeez what were they doing
not hiring gladiators apparently
trying to expand normally
the choice was: stomp nazca before they hit conj 3, or lose.
now hope oceania doesn't steal your win
i've gone full hell bless here. bring it on.
i see your high luck scales, could have blessed harder
*narrator* bug squash lost soon afterwards
maybe the luck was needed for the hell bless
actually i got no business being coy with this nonsense, i got a luck bless thrown on there
oh yeah, i forgot some blesses need that
i odnt know who else is on the desert world, because their army appears to be comprised of a linnormr and 0100% mercenaries
congratulations jimothy, well played! too many birbs üòÉ
awesome pretender name btw
i'm still amazed nobody has dispelled burden of tim
i only put it up because i thought it would last like 2 turns at most
dispel is out of the way, research wise for a lot of people
also astral 5 is pretty uncommon
apres mois les deluge
gg lads
rip nigel farage the kinnara
should have died in a plane crash innit
is there a way of saving the history?
yes
you just never delete the save
i shall treasure this save for evermore
hmm, for what reason would soul slay be marked in red as part of a communion
it doesn't require gems, and i have enough slaves
it doesnt know you have enough slaves
yeah the script doesnt see communions
i thought it always had stuff as grey if you had master set
eh, we'll see if it works i guess
what game was that that just ended?
<#388836798203166730>
nice can i delete the fucking channel for it and never see it again
aka "the ballad of mugsby the cowardly maneater who got trapped in a fort by a massive horror on turn 14 for a couple of years when he should have been blood hunting"
just lol if you dont have the games category collapsed and muted
i have done yeah
but
that horror was fucking hilarious
so screwed over
man is it not horror time yet in late stage capitalism
i just did the n-1 neighbours until finally i was the last neighbour and got owned
<@230792589580697600> it was like turn 10, nowhere near horror time either
it's turn 59
feels longer
mate its turn 58

i have no plan. who's gonna win?

i take it that's a no?
ÁÅ´Ëªä
someone explain to me why misfortune is good now
i hate it
they diluted the event pool with tons of trash
it sucks
and the worst events are tied to things that are not misfortune
so, if you take mis3 and curate your scales appropriately you will not see them ever
the scale matters less and is therefore a dump stat
you can take luck 3 and have your cap sieged by dark vines like <@96715337440952320> and take mis3 and get gold events
it's dumb
i hate it a lot
i'm sick of all these woodhenge terrorists and barbarian immigrants and unemployed monster boars.
they need to release #selectevent so we can fix it
but apparently the only way to do it would be to delete all of the events and make them all over again?
so lmao
monster boars are annoying but barbs and stuff barely matter
mostly you will see like -5 income, +20 unrest in a place, or hay a witch died and there's more misfortune in a place with 3 misfortune already
but like quad dark vines on your cap should maaaaaaaybe be locked out by luck
basically make the scale more of a determinant on event pool so it's worth it
on your cap within year 1
good shit
the ubiquitous forest troll invasion seems to be another popular luck 3 one
there it is
event id [id]:    699
rarity [rarity]:    uncommon bad
 
requirements:
forest [req_forest]:    must be forest
turmoil scale [req_chaos]:    1
 
effects:
commander [com]:    #2219 forest troll
commander [2com]:    #2219 forest troll x 2
units [2d6units]:    #2219 forest troll x 2d6
the forest trolls are making trouble.
like what the fuck illwinter
i think it was iloveu that had that roll 15 trolls on like turn 3
what is the command to see who is in the god damn pankor game
type !details in teh pankor channel
event 699... nice...
what is pankor channel
o wtf
wtf no one told me there was a channel for this game
hello
don't worry nobody was talking behind your back
i have formed a seventeen player coalition to kill you
not a soul
so since the noobie game is over
someones gonna host a new game right
a boobie game
everybody is in pankor
!details

the chokepoints in this game mean that the n-1 strat won't work so well
pankor sucks
pankor is like 4 simultaneous gmaes going on at once
and im only in one of them!! all that lost value
shinuyama got wrecked damn.
don't worry you get to experience the globals and the merc-stealing of the other games
give it 10 turns
should have signed up to pankor 4 times bicth
i did
it was a huge problem
lol
the bot supports you playing multiple nations in a game
i think
it absolutely seems to
you do get the turn notifications for all players at once lol
and dominions does
so what's the problem???
ir
or
you can just say !details pankor
and pretend the pankor channel doesnt exist
can everyone please kill cryle

id be up for another less mental game
i'll pass, yomimod and pankor are both early turns so i'd get mega fucked in 20 turns from now
he's right in the far corner of the map
i will pay a cash bounty for every cryle unit killed
!details blanaced_team

im going to poach people from this awful, awful game for my new game]
actually i change my mind
i'd be up for one
!turns
ok what shoul dwe name it
and what age
but the most important part is the name
i am protected
pick something from here imo https://i.imgur.com/zx6qkxa.jpg
more like marignot ha ha ha owned itiot
one of pig is a good marveni god name
ea imo
i want to be a shitty bad nation and get chumped within 2 years
not yomi not water
ok how many people
not 20
lets limit to like less tha n10 for sure
!details

if you have unaging and you put a shroud on a guy
do they suddenly get  younger
:sagacious:
no unaging doesn't make you younger
you just age 1/4 the speed from then on
it does also make you younger, at recruitment
so in this case: no shroud does not work
but the bless means your sacreds are recruited as younger men
cryle is 1 throne point from victory
and has a vampire lord
we really honestly do need to kill him though
you arent even in this game riidi
huh these are some interesting graphs #freethegraphs
!details

gotta go to bed for now, but we'll all be seeing some stuff soon
that's his secret
i am very limited in who i can kill
right now i can attack like 2 of ewies provinces
and then hire ichtyids to invade under the sea
you are also limited in other ways
what happened to human alliance decrepus
my inbox was filled up human spam
but i need friends against the bird people underwater assholes and lava man hybrids
other than cryle the human alliance is still in effect
pythium has fallen to the bird people
wtf?
who was pyth
and how did shinu already go ai, like wtf is even going on
unaging does make you younger in terms of time spent learning magic
okay so pythium was some dude, and started with a cap adjacent to nazca
because we used the wrong number of players
shinu was jbre and he is burned out and also failed many expansions / got his god killed
lol
so pyth got rushed by an awake pretender or what
pyth failed to rush nazca
and then nazca hit conj3 and made hellbless condors
lol
monkee and i are both let's playing this game
dominions 5 is a goode videogam
youtube or just posts
it's dumber and more brokener than dominions 4, with more options and faster battles and weirder stuff
so yes
ulm went ai? wtf
youtube
noice
backwanzus is a pretender god
please make your way to east planet and own me so i can appear in a video
you're on the forest planet with no mobility
i'm sorry
is that the only planet like that? tbh i havent bothered to look at the map much
:i
*in map with teleportation technology voice*    this is an impassible mountain
it's the worst of them i think
are you lping it live or delayed? if delayed link channels please so i can get notifications
if live link channels please
i'm by all the interconnected farmland, it's awesome
ports!

should have told the ai he had a nap with me
please be aware that this channel has been deleted, and it is no longer possible to post to it.
mekone
i killed the people leading his troops
monkee needs to be home, in the evening, to record lps i think
that seems like its a pretttttttty fucking bad outcome jon joe
i'm trying to get some other stuff done before i record mine
christ
i'm putting up my lp unlisted until there is enough of a delay for me to feel safe
...uh
this game is still happening??
so
fair point
what magisters arcane do at tur n15 is communioned tstrike i guess that was fairly obvious
(you can mute subchannels samgo, i have muted all of the ones for games i am not in)
so after arcane nexus
or never yes
too late. i have already deleted the channel
did buggos own them
no
having three tower knights as the entire armed forces owned them
that was an attack
uhhh
how unfortunate
im pythium. i make ass ass in
https://puu.sh/zi8pw/a8ca1b287c.jpg
lanka attacked me with wolves.
unprovoked ai aggression
im the mage not deployer generally
i spent like a thousand design points on making these lil fuckers read books good so im gunna read books good
game idea: disciples but each team is actually a single player logging in as 3 nations
that sounds awful boing
why would you say these things
you can have 3x as much fun
playing 3 nations at once
taking 3 turns per day
haha therodos has a bigger army than everyone combined, and double the forts of the second place.
im in seven games so i already take three turns per day
i think iloveu wanted to make one of those
but with 2 nations per player
i think i might become a dominions five streamer
lol <@178868273935417344> did you delete your fort so i cant have it
i will stream all of my turns , along with whatever music happens to be playing, whenever i happen to play them
and have open mic on so you can hear my music twice and maybe i will say something sometimes
hmmm
should i report that it should be magisters arcane not magister arcanes
in the bug report thread
greatings
i will record in approximately six hours. get fuckkkked
hell yeah
your seventy eight province defense brutally owned them
it also owned me, because now im tied down with a bunch of morons walking around because i can't beat seventy eight pd with 20 guys
absolutely
are there people on twitch streaming dominions five
is that a thing
who knows
be the change you wanna see in the world
i think the aggresively anti-viewer stance i  have formulated would be funny though
i agree
also my pipes are realllllly fucking bad so it would look like total trash
on account of i cant upload fast enough for it not to
stream via potato
https://www.twitch.tv/helmseye
this dudes live rn
this guy owns lol
to 1 viewer
well 2 now
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/226350818
ahaa what a coincidence
office tim aged terribly
he's floating 10k gold
what a coincidence we both looked at the only guy playing dominions
lol
hes forted every water province
and is using them all to make three and a half coral guards
and no mages
noice
hence the ten thousand gold
hes
empowered a indie priest
to earth 2 fire 1
to search on land
this guys amazing holy shit
lol
holy shit
i like this guys straightforward and down to eath narration
massively undermining the epic nature of the into text
who was he narrating for aren't you guys the only two viewers
yeah its surreal
im invisible
so he had 1 viewer before we came along
hes just distilled four gold
oh i think im watching the start of the stream
his empowered e2f1 indie priest is just reading books
im losing my fucking mind
*while sitting on 10 thousand gold* hmm i think i should take my fire gems and... make gold
is he smaug irl
he just
put seven sevent troops
onto a king of the deep
one at a time
unimaginably powerful
aaaaaaaaahhh
lm,ao
im going to replace the entire original post of the dominions five thread with this guys stream
who was the person asking if there was guids for how to play nations
goonrush the chat with wisdom
lmao
this guy needs to do the guides for every nation
[9:10 am] botnevermore: its just delete all game.
i changed my mind the bot can do the guides
lol
we found the niefel guy
i feel like we have
a moral duty
not to interfere in the development of this player
hes spent a thousand gold on mercenaries
he is a treasure
his fuckin
oh my god
his epithets
master of patience
communicating with him can only do harm
5 viewers hes going viral
lmao
im going insane
adding units one at a time to a squad
please continue narrating so i don't have to watch but  can enjoy
"him, and him, and him, and him, and him...."
master of patience doing his thing
looking good
jerek you are learning how to lp dominions my man
x5
that guy has five viewers
hes searched his capital
4 are in this chat
can never be too sure jsoh
oh hes closed the game by acicdent and now its hist desktop
i only see 3 watching now
use the n key
aaah
whats on his desktop
please it's not obvious not to search your cap
master of patience does not push n
hahahahahaha
he selects every province, one at a time, and examines every single commander and unit
every turn
"what can we build"
"build a lab"
im crying
"how about you"
i would go prodromal within 2 seconds watching so i'm not going to
"build a lab as well"
same province
its year 5 and hes waiting for the ai to attack him im certain
did he just install the game and start playing like an hour ago
maybe like 3 hours ago
i like his broody hand through hair thing
i dont know
watch the ai be on easy or something
so it's sitting in the corner banging its head on the heavy cav in its cap circle in y5
oh the sound went for a bit
and then it came back
the ai seems to own all the land
two labs in a province = twice as much research
he owns
like 5 sea provinces
lmao
aaahahahaha
and is attacking a corner of the land now
10k gold off of 5 sea
"im a bit ocd so im going for this corner first"
its year 5 late summer
time to start his first war
and hes resarching construction 5 , to go with conjuration 4 and alteration 1
fuck
please someone tell him to press ?
i have to go do a bunch of work where i c ant look at this chat
i dont want to emiss out
"it's a shame george, that your blanket broke when y" *he mutes his wife or girlfriend or daugher*
if any one of you talks in this mans chat i will ban you forever
yeah
agreed 100%
do not
he has a witcher scar
grandad geralt slowly looking for his lazy commanders
hes just fully lost one of his forts
yeah its basically my way of ensuring whoever takes my cap pays a reasonable price for it
he had a mage idle and he looked through every province except one like 3 times
not like the gold would help me with how resource heavy jomon units are
lmao
!details

he fucked off!
sad
come back and stream you shirker
no!
evidently someone has come to him with a contract to slay a cockatrice
he seems to have been debating whether or not to equip pills of water breathing on his monolith that has been underwater for 6 years
to set the scene for everyone whos not watching
he needs the money to get a perception increasing potion so he can find that idle mage province
this is a 45 year old married man
with slicked back white hair
geralt plays dominions five
geralt meets tim from the office
hes english or maybe welsh or something and his wife keeps bothering him
and he takes constant breaks to make cups of tea
but seriously, the rng ai *hates* jomon
it is cold where he is - he has added 2 layers of clothing in as many minutes
i don't think i've seen so many random province conquest events in the first turns
sometimes he clicks on items then looks at a commander
then back to the item
i think he is probably playing for a first time
the cycle repeats, but he plods on
or like a second
he has vods of himself streaming other games
he is the best dominions five streamer
hes started his attack!
oh i thought he went off line
geralt of slough leaps into action
how many individually assembled troops are there in his army
no he just left to put on a sweater and get some tea
for those of you not watching: "he's gonna go here"..."he's gonna go here"... xn
oh my god
the corner province has 2 river connections and hes just fucking baffled
lol
i dig his persistence
hes attacking with just his thrice empowered completely unscripted mage of the deep i think
he's brute forcing construction
he just tried clicking on like four different items
while it kept telling him he didn't have enough gems
this is so funny and i dont know why
ok he figured out the river
its sick i love it
yeah
i feel like im watching a child learning to walk
mate hes not learning to walk hes sitting in the corner pissing himself
does he
that's step 0 of learning to walk
not know how to watch battles
i dont think he does
or view battle reports
ive not seen him click on the messages
hes just building a fort a temple and a lab in every province
one by one the troops are moved
it's a child learning to ride a bike
oh my god click the repeat recruitment box pleeeease
master of patience eschews automation
who had not learned to walk or even balance
someone make a master of patience mod where there are no shortcuts, no viewable battle reports, no multi select, no repeat recruitment
once he starts losing hes not going to have any idea how
or why
not enough palisades
or even that hes losing i think
did he figure out how to upgrade the forts
i mean
yes
also how has he never clicked on a message
he builds everything with every commander
oh god hes never going to be able to lose is he
tiatanic.
unless this incredibly bad ai can come and take his throne
the ai will eventually will accidentally make a powerful amphibious thing
"you're only good for researching" he said with an air of dissapointment earlier when no further forts could be built
hes spelt titanic wrong oh my god
thanks in advance tanic looks right to me
master of patience.
master of patience, great defender
üòâ
37rp per month turn 72
his thrice empowered mage of the deep is just building a castle that will never be used to recruit anything
i finally understand who the target audience is for this game.
castling is a very powerful move have you played chess?
the game is so fuckign bad in this manner
tanic the samog
like he must have some inkling that hes not doing this correctly right
just had a thought - this can't be live, he's in bright sunlight
mate its england theres never been bright sunlight in this mans life
hes got a professional streamering setup
someone from illwinter needs to contact this man
this is depressing i'm not watching any further.
his skin looks pretty good
he clicked on a battle
this dude is 45 and wants to be a full time streamer.
i am 35 and i want to be a full time loafer
he has 4 viewers and it's us and he sucks ass.
he believes in himself
i think its inspiring
if he believed in himself he'd have more candles
he streams until 2am every thursday and friday.
surely the accumulated wisdom of the turn time tips could have got him out of this hole by now
i'm done with this.
turn tips are a well of immense wisdom for him
you'll never be a master of patience with that attitude
game-specialist , games-tester, games-reviews, game-youtuber love playing board games and pc games that make me think too hard
i think it's probably his first day playing
oh no dont   spoil the magic
i am 32 and want to be a full time loafer
keep the dream alive
i would say i am about a 75% loafer rn
and constantly broke as hell
i worked like 20 weeks last year so im pretty solidly a part time loafer
seasonally yaknow
yeah sometimes i work like 80 hours in a week
and other times i am sick for a month, i guess
yeah working 30 12+ hour days in a row is standard for me
"working"
i was driving around cleveland delivering food, and then i got guns brandished or pointed at me twice so i stopped doing that
standing around in a place you would not normally stand around in qualifies as work
ive been promoted so far beyond my capabilities. now i sit around in a place i would not normally sit around
good deal
same
though in all honestly, this office is nicer than my apartment
my upcoming job i will be sitting around some place thats really far away
well its been quite a ride but that's enough palisade contruction simulator for one day
lol
so once im done they will drive me to another place to sit around and also sleep and then feed me food and drink for free
i will be checking in on his progress, watching from afar like alec guinnes
thats the best part of showing up to work
guy probably spent a week setting up his professional-quality perfectly lit greenscreened ass face cam for his dream of streaming himself clicking one unit at a time for 4 people watching him ironically, full time.
eating free food and coffee other people bought
<@184675842432040960> so are we going to fight for arakis now or in a few turns?
honestly being an adult is so much like daycare now
im 5 years old , except forever
<@317410996169736204> you're right, this is soul crushingly depressing
its fucking precious
i don't think it's that depressing
i suspect he gets more views on some of the shit he does
and i suspect he will eventually learn. i kinda hope he doesn't though.

lol
yeah therodos the nation that is totally stymied by one of those priest statues
every single water province they could access is rock walls now
i want to see bb8 getting raped
all evidence points to him just starting to do this this week
i killed 3 of rlyehs priest statues so far
it's honestly been an enjoyable game so far
or wait i guess twitch affiliate vods only last a week so
could be forever
turtle up in my pond, get free access to the next pond and then the one rlyeh is in
so he bought all this stuff to set everything up and just plays games. does his wife work to buy him games
spam temples everywhere, watch freespawn go fucking whoa
or does he work and this is what he does on his days off
he might be retired? he has white hair and a witcher scar
i dont think you are allowed to retire in engerland anymore
he's 45
its true you must work until you die
that's may's excise
sorry i am not allowed to retire now
in the anglosphere you just work until death now i think
you say "now" but it's always been that way
since 1066 and the fucking french came over
he streams after working i think
jeremy corbyn professional ck2 twitch streamer

do you get it, like profit
(jk it was the same before then too)
but prophet, and theres none, cuz it got killed by 3 militia
jesus christ willus i thought that was the markov bot then
you scared the shit out of me
well my grandfather was a mechanic for airplanes and stuff and he stopped working twenty years ago and still has a good standard of living
so there was a brief window there where you didn't work until you died unless you felt like it
he plays as a muslim republic every game
lol
wtf were you talking about
the newest pro dom5 streamer
looks like ai pan is rip
the newest, best, worst and only dom5 streamer
37 rp late game
wtf
i want to play in a game with him
well if you graphed forts he's probably winning
is he playing the ai
i like that there is a thunder dome planet
2 nations, one way in and out
of course
the real question is who is winning
which studio would fuck up dominions more: creative assembly or paradox
ca
they would make it prettier but that's not what this fucked up game is about
they'd probably sell more copies too
which is the worst pat
i am playing another game with this map that adds extra connections
2 ways off the desert world
kinda ruins the theme of desert world
the theme being "haha look at the poor dumb idiots who started in that shithole"
the same one here
desert world is absolutely a shithole and not probably the most gem and gold rich start per tile üòÆ
so dont bother coming here!!
im sure it will be gem rich as all hell
and a dome that leads to the water moon and cave moon
:bless: moons
but the income is going to be a piece of shit outside of the gold mines and handful of central provs
which is kind of important in the early game

pay attention to the discussion geez
everyone else was talking about paths
no?
"whats an ea nation with astral and death"
- makes a list of them
yes
"no i mean in terms of gems they get for free"
???
yeah exactly
starting gems
i am sorry if you experienced difficulty in your haste to respond to a question with an incorrect answer.
i dont think anyone actually has starting sd in ea do they
i dont think so
tc
oh do they get one of each in their random assortment of gems
maybe two s
tc does oops
yeah'
s2d1
you would think sauromatia would
they got so much astral
sauro has to search it up as does niefel
by so much astral you mean astral one
for ea that is an astral powerhouse monkee please do not belittle their 90% of s1 on a unit and s1 on a 145g mage
90% on an s1 has some insane game mechanic breaking implication or something
i remember vaguely
you can make it from a fort without a lab
the huge gigantic implication of not having to build a lab
so you save 500g from every research fort
kind of
which is half the cost of a fort
except you want to be able to make enaries probably
and maybe dumb priestess things
right and transfer gems around and teleport and so on eventually
and if you are saccing, not having labs sucks
yes exactly
and you lose a turn of research on your guyss
cause they have to walk
the bot agrees w me
and some of them are only useful to put in your cap to stop bad events extremely infrequently
and the president(?) agrees w me
or sometimes tell you something great like "in 3 turns the stars will be right for enchantment"
well, if you take a retarded god like i did you have luck so no bad events bing bong so simple
nice
good luck in your travels
except the part where you are fucking owned by gaia throne
who spawns a gemmed ivy lord who spams swarm
also, monster boars
and well actually you know what fuck luck
i think luck patala getting completely trashed within year 1 was a big part of me being done with the game for a bit lol
yea thats messed up
it is quite insanely fucked up to have multiple income loss events and then an unbeatable attack on turn 10 with luck imo
take misf3 and spam fortune tellers in your cap, like me
200 points right there going to waste
at the same time he was having this happen, i, mis3 utgard
was getting gold events
https://i.imgur.com/qa4kdno.png
misf was already good in dom4 and now its ultra fucked
all of the new events fucked everything up
good dog
and the scales were lessened in effect
apart from growth
i mean the event related parts
which was... made stronger...
oh right
scales as a whole were fucked up
basically when designing a god you start with growth 3 unless you are popkill
yeah it's all fucked up and they're not interested in fixing it because they're in coe brain mode where you just load up a game, play it co op while you do something else, and if you get shafted by events you laugh it off and load up another one
in their extremely overcomplicated pbem 4x game that takes months
<:illwinter:372894192894214176>
thinking man: take 2d so people cant siege u good
*halves effectiveness of siege defense*
are any of the other beta testers
asking them to fix scales
and event
s
fuck
zonk and algulod are the most active and i don't think so
zonk is the best beta tester to ever live
hm
i think i hung out with them in their shitty irc long enough that
if i asked them to bring it up they might
though that was a couple years ago so maybe they forgot
are scales moddable i never checked
kind of
if you could most scales and #selectevent it'd be fine
you can mod some of scales
and yes i asked for select event and 105xx and 106xx spell effects but no dice
cause some autist (it's me) would go in and change event requirements
to not be stupid bullshit, and crank luck back up
more than once i have asked about select event
even the z man
and red rob and the others
have all asked
so i'm guessing they just cannot do it
it will randomly appear in a patch note in like two years after everyone forgot
i would get alarm blaring sirens from the dom 5 modding crew in my pms if it appeared lol
instead of people who have been referred to me to ask about cataclysm
because i tested it twice in the beta days when the game wasn't out
so for some reason the other beta testers keep sending strange people to ask me how it works like i would be any better informed than they would be after 10 minutes
there are three monster boar events
hell yeah
none are bound to anything but growth. good shit
what are the rarities
because there is also an autohappening one you can send at people
2 of them are 2.
ok so uncommon bad
the other one is gaia
w t f is the mod inspector
so the monster boar spell right
is 42 which is remote event but the damage is 11?
and event 11 is definitely not that
unless it goes by id which maybe it does actually
yes that is it
sorry i am being deranged
i think a lot of stuff in the mod inspector for dom 5 stuff is bugged / displaying wrong
2155 is the monster boar event
yes a lot of it is fucked atm
and larz doesn't know how to cross creck things also like what missing effects are wrt what has those properties which is annoying
doesn't help that the tags are often not what the mod tags are
which is understandable but also kind of a pain in the ass
388 and 2155 both have event id 11 for monster boar
does it randomly pick? who knows
they both have the same text so it doesn't actually matter
lmao event 272
and auto-triggered events don't rely on scales
it's a plague event. death 3 common bad
thats it. that's the requirement
it's black death event
it's limited to turn 15 at least
i got a plague event in my cap in pankor
lost 80% of prov income there
but i think the event chain ended
and it went back to normal
there were a lot of other bad things that could have happened
so
and you have cultivate the wasteland scales
so lmao
event 283 is el classico eat shit turmoil event
ah you have turmoil 1, 35 unrest and 100% tax loss
i'm glad they made it turn 5 and onwards
after turn 6 in ea especially your cap income is more or less disposable
yep
even 280 looks pretty badass too
def do not need to buy expensive mages
you can lose 10% of your pop on the first turn because you have low candles
lol if you have not had that event in crucial provs especially if you have had dominion loss events such as demons attacking
384 is almost undoubtedly the shittest event in the game to recieve
10% pop loss and your extremely good hero does, in return skogu gets one path boost
kirke never showed for me
just skogu by his lonesome
there are so many fucking bad events
so so many
you'd basically need to dump the whole table out and edit like 25% of them
the ones that just attack people are some of the worst in terms of drama
whos skogu
there's so many crippling poploss events
and attacks
unbound by luck at all
skogu is a sauromatian hero
ah
he is basically as good as a normal cap only mage
but his superpower is that he eats blood slaves
and if he's in the same province as your a2s2d4n4 hero he can sometimes kill and eat her and 10% of the entire population
mine made some vampires and read books
and gain 1 blood
i believe i am now up to vampires (3)
at this rate, i will have double digits the turn i am killed by someone
i think you're gonna win that game monkee

im about to die in that game jerek
im pretty sure im getting horrored this turn
oh shit
it's turn 50 and i just got const6
so uh, im not going to survive

ah good
remember abysia is in the game, acquired kailasa very early and has been sitting there unmolested for like 30 turns
so we are all dead probably
oh yeah good point
well i know what my strategy is for whatever game remains
he didn't actually storm kai until like year 3. it was back and forth for a while
wasn't he sitting on it for a while
(anyone know what turn capitalism (cataclysm) begins?)
just collecting that cash money
yeah. but later on i thought
the fact that you can stand on someone's caps and make ghouls is very good
<@255835336083636234>  yes that's my game, no you can't have mictlan
[11:49 am] jerek: well i know what my strategy is for whatever game remains
case rain?
yes
definitely
its me the big bad abysia [sound of someone undoing their fly and starting to piss]
gg!
i will kill infinity boars until the horrors come. then i will embrace oblivion
witness
im even magic 3
there is no feasible way that i survive lol
hahaha
i actually already have my death plan going
i have not spent a death gem for over a year
(it's burden of time)
heh
abysia probably won't care. but its the least i could do
make him pay the boot tax
its not a game about winning anyway
its a game about making everyone else mad
agreed
i had no idea how to make ryleh performant

mass tstrike spam looks way cooler in dom5
than in dom4
so do meteors
though i miss the supremely goofy sprites
oh did they change tstrike
tstrike already had a pretty good feel to it in dom4 even
new meteors are indeed cool as fuck
the simultaneous casts
oh god that's right
actually they get staggered a little
so you get like 5 strikes in one second
very slightly but it's like a wave of lightning
also it stuns now i guess
of course it does
problem: in dom4 lightning is the best element hands down but sometimes enemies can move
solution: lightning now causes short term paralysis
jesus christ dude you have shadow blast
who
caelum
oh
isnt that like evo 6
5
oh less impressive
me and berytos got into an arrow fight
see stuff like "lightning or blood is too good for x reasons" bugs me way less than growth being too good, or luck being useless
because like, you can play around the strengths of nations and use them to get other nations to help you kill them sometimes
but the scales being busted just
makes there less ways to play
not that some more good water and fire stuff would be unappreciated
i guess it's supposed to be the equivalent of cold freezing you
and fire setting you on fire
and earth uh
embedding you in the earth sometimes
that was a lot of arrows
but all my mercs died :((

now that some time has passed on dom5, i'm curious
how are battlefield-wide nukes shaping up?
ros got nerfed, but i haven't even seen it in dom5 yet

i wonder if i could just steal the spell tbh
you can't have overcast it too much
if you steal the spell do you steal herne
or is it a new herne
:herne instantly dies to a pythium prophet super hydra:
probably the same
what keeps aging him

he just ages 2-300 years every turn

i'm planning on waiting until he collapses under the weight of oceania before grabbing his land

have you seen him yet?

the worm mage cast enlarge on his bettle friends every round
hah no
he's an inch past me with a million murderdemons

does enlarge stack
did star kid get dog piled by twenty scabiels
no but he makes 1d6 beetles every turn
what the i just got attack reared by indies and owned
lol
poor squids
should stay in the water
that was in the water
sea trolls with a cunning mind

just tremendous
they killed about 500g of stuff including my prophet. i am owned
so every turn he has new freidns to make large beetles
that owns
worm mage as programmed by illwinter *being larger is very strong*
all hail
if man-sized beetles had man-sized bites they would be powerful
it worked tbh
but they probably have 1 an damage tiny bite
regardless of how big they become.
the beetles destroyed the star kid
it worked because he could have picked his nose and won
because he's a worm mage
his nose is full of beetles, yes
hey, that star kid had 1 pearl
he could have been dangerous
he could have uhh
paralyzed him, and still died
i cant check the game but my vanheres probably died to lanka fort pd
bc they have markatas and vanheres suck at mowing through markatas
they are so small
so tiring to murder
their only weakness is reaching their kill limit and shutting down
we have just the best indies in this game
*clears throat* that makes them smart.
nvm i won because my idiot vanjarls spent like 10 gems against 20 pd
first rule ofvanhiem
no gems on jarls
items are okbut no raw gems
i had storm and air elementals in case the ai brought his army, but he did not
now i have no gems. thanks vanjarls
all that markata hp scared them
lets see the battle report
this is bullshit
i guarded that commander
with troops
too bad
theres rolls for that
ye well grats you assassined my ability to win
:)
assassin 2 btw
so ++ patience
still very lucky that i rolled out on the one guy who would win me the battle with like 18 commanders there
with only 3 rolls
do bodyguards defend in seduction attempts
yes
seducers are generally patience 0
did you see nuclearmonkey the battle report
i'm lping it. turn 10 is the turn of the sea trolls with the best brains
of me insanely brutally destroying jon joe
by pure luck
they're in a hurry to get that bone on
what battle report
https://puu.sh/zifi0/88757b81d7.jpg
whoa that's pain
did you assassinate the commander holding all of the troops
https://puu.sh/zifia/e38e4bd4de.jpg i assassinated the guy leading this
lmao
and 1 magister arcane
well, he has a bunch of forts and gold now
so that's like 3 turns worth of stuff
its turn 15
this is a pretty substantial smack
what were they even casting on turn 15
like lightning bolt
tstrike
thunderstrike
in communion
la man has insanely good research
rip
due to drain immune
i can cast uhhh
make afraid
and 1.5 magisters arcane / turn
i can cast moak
who sends out 13 mage with 3 knights as blocker though
i‚Äôm casting
go ai
of course you are
because you are a tiny baby jon joe.
i attacked libluini because he was small and didn't seem to be able to stop me
i'm casting ski weekend!!!!! woooooo!
but then i remembered ktonian reanimators are +10 res so he actually has a shitton of res no matter what i do
yes but otoh only in 1 fort and i'm p sure la agartha fort pd is not good
he's got a lot of xbows now. im just dancing around
which faction are you
i've already destroyed one of my own forts
weak to arrow: the nation
utgard
he speed utgard
hes jotunheim but lame
ah not a fun assassin nation
utgard is jotunheim but without parental supervision
the nether darts faction
i can kill him if he touches my candles though
because my god is insanely good
are their seithkona still 85 gold
!unit seith

jon joe are you going to be like the guy in 2001 where i owned the shit out of him and then he went ai and his ai effortlessly destroyed me
something like that. i am producing a fort in every province i can afford to
i hope so
which is a lot, since i have nothing of value to make besides some sacreds and chaff and wizards
many seithkona
seithkonar ftw
quote the raven, nether `darts`
more like nether farts
i just learned panic i didn't go evo
powerful
i have alt for dog and panic
woah
rushing thaum 5 and then more alt for luck/ethereal?
+ swarm
no i stopped at 3. i need panic
plz dont burden my time
i have swarm
oh wait no i dont
ilove too panic.
i almost have swarm. i have alt3
powerful
i too am a nearly swarm haver, in bad game
i need panic to defeat seventy eight jomon pd
i kind of want to have my god find gems but i will lose like a billion rp if i do that
lmao

lol, just lol if you don't have 3 gods
literally 78 pd
unless he's made more, which is possible
lol if u dont add 100 rp/turn per turn
i have a solution monkee: bvc the province until it gets below 780 people
i own all of his provinces except his cap. he tried to break out and hit the province in his cap circle that generated knightly order the turn i took it
which i put 25 pd in
nevermorebot - today at 4:05 pm
gonadic is to figure out my mispelled lobby
and killed all of his things to the man
this one is good imo
christ
i guess with 78 pd you can't even bvc it
hmm
what a powerful strat
should i murder this guy making a fort
always
or wait for him to make a fort and take it
or that i guess
killing the fort is more enraging
hes already going ai
and as la pythium you tend to want very few fort
ah
on account of my extremely good assassin
in that case probably kill it so they ai can't make 9999 lion tribe/turn out of it
your bullshit assassin
hey man i had 3 tries
could have given every ma 10 longbowmen jj
or 15 even due to fire
that wasn‚Äôt the issue
the thing is that wasnt the first assassination it shouldnt have bene a surprise
it is if your army doesn't move jj
if every magister brought 10 troops i would ahve lost that battle badly
and you would not have lsot your wizard pile
look i‚Äôm just bad ok
and , you had 2 commanders
so why not split troops between them?
it's okay to be bad but please do not flame people trying to explain some ways to combat assassins
the second commander was more troop
coming in
he went into the battle and brough 3 knights tho?
.tags jsoh
**epic rp pythium bully**
oh he was coming from the other province
i get it nevermind
ye
my troop pile for the actual fight wasn‚Äôt going to be large
just like 20 dudes
its la you only lost 14 mages
dont go ai! instead nap me imo
it‚Äôs too late
and let me have whats mine and we cna be friends and kill uhh , caelum together
i already submitted the ai turn
you can undo it
there is no honor in storming the cap of an ai.
theres n ofucking way im going to storm the cap of that ai
hes still man with scales lmao
or i could it will just take fucking ages
and all his troops are on the inside lol
jj reset the turn, send in a half turn where you don't go ai, and then do the turn
13 mages is quite recoverable as la man, probably the 2nd strongest la faction
did you at least bump one other nation so i dont have to spend the entire rest of the game fighting fuckin gobs of ai longbows
: (
keep in mind j soh lost quite a lot of troops there
i thought la man was only average, did it change in dom5
yes it owns
i mean magisters arcane were already good
actually they are called magister arcanes in canon boing.
due to the rec point changes it gets 1.5 of its very useful mages / turn from its best forts and its xbow/heavy infantry are still limited by res not rec whereas a lot of its competitors are rec choked
boing how do you feel about me destroying my own fort
dammit
ok thats not a perfect implementation there
im still laughing though
lol
mostly i‚Äôm just burnt out ok
what are you talking about jsoh thats perfect
its good absum, sieging down forts sucks
i think the robot trying and failing over and over again to use the ancient forms would maybe be better
absum do you ahve any death gems
ill trade you bvc for death gems at cost
.q add absum boing how do you feel about me destroying my own fort
nevermorebot - today at 4:21 pm
very carefully.
no give me your death gems
they are for tomb kings only
ill trade you your own cap for death gems.
jonjoe send me all of your gems so when i lose i will have enough to alch for bot
wow.
i mean i will just dispell it because im pythium
but we should follow the mega man rules in all things
where the guy who made you go ai gets your shit
i am the mega man
the robot masters dont give their powers to the other robot masters, they give it to mega man
lol none of you are getting shit
even more ai chaff to fight
send it to me
dibs on all of the provinces
im dying
it‚Äôs true monkee will probably get all the provinces
wrong
how big is ragha for real though
ragha is going to walk directly through me
they are ginormous
problematic
theya re all the way to patala now
jsoh ive some death gems but im not yet ready to kill my own mage
well i already have thau3 and thau4 is right there
they have taken one of my m16 provinces but i dont think it best to argue about them
has nobody researched a spell to kill zhayedans yet
also i can only afford one
i can kill them once i have alt4 thau4 pretty easily
raghu is also
right next to me
and me
if the guy has fire shield i cannot defeat him in any way
whats his bless
i dunno
nice!
also my supercombatant sacreds can trade with zhayedan in melee
quickness regen right
he doesn't have fire shield it's quickness/regen/blood surge / something else
and i have more of them
i can maybe defeat them by assassinating everything
but luckily i will be stuck fighting la man ai until ragha wins the game
isnt he recruiting zhayedan spahbeds every turn
im sure it will be easy to assassinate zhayedan spahbed
yes
like 3 of them every turn
is he giving them holy water
^ every day his intelligence grows
fuck my life
he isn't giving them holy water
good hopefully he doesn't figure that out
i'm not sure he even has the mages to do that or the technology
it's const2
so hes just walking them around leading guys
and he can make those wizards
!item holy water
<@148098869782118401>: https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/?page=item&itemq=holy%20water&showmodcmds=1&showmoddinginfo=1&showids=1
with someone to bless
he's walking them around with his prophet
who is also a zheyedan spahbed
such advanced tactics
oh well if he fucks with me ill just destroy him then
lol if you don‚Äôt spend the first 20 turns without research
maybe that game shouldn't have had a name a mile long
you just walked atm e on turn 15 with a thunderstrike communion you fraud
zhayedan with quick have a kill limit and i can cast swarm
like as patala i killed quite a lot of them in our one battle
it is doable
well lol at me then
i dont have strength 20 guys with 2 handed weapons
you have gladiators
i should have gone with the extremely good strat of playing ragha
you will need a lot of them
cast storm imo
spamming pythium storm of thorns + gladiators should wreck them easily
w/ some swarm probs
he will rout me turn 1 if he concentrates forces at all im sure
will his spahbeds die when you cast bot
yeah if he puts everything together you would need like two hundred gladiators and literally all of your wizards
no
and like 20 nature gems worth of swarm
.markov swarm
maek insect is zhayedan weakness
make insect is everything‚Äôs weakness that isn‚Äôt make skeletons
also my giants
who would brutally slay a 1hp insect with a forty five damage strike
yeah having a 40 damage axe is a pretty glaring weakness
cleaving units when illwinter?
cleaving units exist
no i have a plan if i am engaged with insects
it is insect wars 2018
bug on bug
no hold bars
i think i can probably insect harder than you
but maybe not anybody else
you can but you don't want to move that many wizards away from your land
and im not attacking you
!details

i think we should make <@!148098869782118401> kill ragha
i should go for stellar focus/haunted forest right
agreed
he's big and rich as fuck
boing it's your job
best part of lanights is the perpetual bogarus-ctis slapfight lol
boing and jon joe
isn't it just mostly ctis dunking on bogarus
boing is gtoing to get brutally destroyed by a single call lesser horror cast
untrue i have skeletons
seems likely
bog is fighting back
also two devils
wow 2 devils
he's already got a little bit of chariot production going
and a lot of forts. many skeleton
boing has a bajillion units on my border
well
my former border
lol
im going to try and attack the seventy eight pd
whats my rp path here
if i lose i will be lping it
its enchantment istn it
and it will be very funny
do you already have your make garbage spells
panic maybe
then haunted woods
panic is n2 your dumb idiots can't do it
you get vine arrow and swarm
when you make like 10 a turn and they have 10% n2
yes you can
lol
did you cast moak yet i didn't pay attention
no but i bet he will
next turn
im making the stick now
my rp is actually super bad
panic is a tiny detour so getting it is probably good
on account of that mishap with the skelemans
do you have make wolf garbage to go with make bug garbage
and some conflicts meaning in need more troops
can also pick up lamias up there
lamia queen is blood and death and stuff
yeah
i think enchantment maybe more important
what for
for orbital tree strikes and haunted woods
oh. are your candles actually big enough for haunted wood
dont you want the other thing
uh
everyone next ot me seems rude
whatever spreads candles
wow rude
and theres going to be one billion fucker ass hole mans walking at me

it will just build random trash which will get hacked to pieces

why did you bring an army with wrathful skies
there was seven hundred ai caleum birbs
there's literally no way to protect yourself from horrible casualties unless you have very high hp things or lots of sr

what a bad feature
can a monolith kill this http://puu.sh/zink6/d2808c424b.jpg
e4 s10 n6
probably. you will need to cast resist lightning
and like, swarm bug
or i guess just howl and sit there like a monolith
does resist lightning stack with elemental fortitude
no it's the same
oh then ill just do fortitude
but air ele do not do that much lightning damage so it should be fine
and monolith will probably kill them somehow
a monolith isnt allowed to regen from strength of gai is it
it is not
<@255835336083636234>
i assume you are teleporting it from a bunch of dom tho so it will have an assload of hp
8 yeah\
it will either win by turn timer or just flat out win eventually
they wll get the 5% s3 random and soul slay you
probably include iron will in its script
the sorc could cast paralyze
resist magic better than iron will
s10
or sure w/e
the sorc has 2s
paralyze would still be fine if its good candles
monolith cant run
hes scripted elemental fortitude earthpwer howl resist magic body ethereal
should be fine
wolves should eventually route the commanders and you win
innate regen doesnt make you die slower of disease does it
this fucking solar serpent has been diseased for at least a year
doesn't regen make you not die from disease
fuck
you just get more and more fucked up forever
you could test easily if you care
just toss a debug mod bvc on something that regen and see if it gets hp loss
isnt the disease affliction check just from getting hit for 10% of your hp over and over
yes
may have some extra checks but i think it's just the hp loss thing
ok no it does give extra checks
and  doenst cause hp los seither
you mean with regen?
yeha
my guys hp never changed
but he lost a eye after 3 months
regen just gets full hp in the heal phase
disease hurts him, is healed
makes sense
that serpent is probably all fucked up by now
yeah
you could wait till it goes feeblemind and assassinate probably
therodos doesnt have assassins
everyone has assassins if you try hard enough
?? use a telkhine to summon a lamia queen with blood and get a heart of being a good assassin
i have a total of 1 blood path
v simple
telkhines do not have nature path
do you have manifestation
except on the heroes
w t f
ok well get the hero
the heroes do not have death path
luckily you have gemmers
i also dont have nature gems
dang this is a real humdinger
don't you have d from something
anything
manifestation is cool and good
yes
use the 1 blood person to make a heart of the damned or w/e anyway
and then give a shademail to a daktyl and brutally destroy someone with spartae summons
this is the easiest plan in history
hmm
you should get the one blood path guy to blood two and make a black heart
ya
im sure you have some fucker stealth thing that could win
if i cast manifestation and then the ashen angel decides to come and kill my telkhine whos holding a ring of wizard and a ring of sorcer in order to be allowed to cast this spell it would be pretty bad
give the telkhine things to prevent that probably
lol if you don't lose your ring of sorc doing an incredibly strategic remote teleport attack vs someone who doesn't script their mages enough so you don't even burn any gems before they die
i could just have the telkhine walk into the province and kill everything if the solar serpent is feebleminded
some of the shit in there has poison res doesn't it
fire snake and clay man
telkhine also have fifteen paths
i mean if you can just cast a magic and blow everyone up that works
i just realzied i have a hekateride scripted to cast foul vapours in the same battle i have a telkhine walking around
im so dum
b
lol

oh jsoh you could forge that acorn necklace for the monolith
with elemental fortitude he's 20sr and lightning will not harm him
also he becomes a lucky rock
what is the problem here is it a solar serp throne
no it's a throne with air wizards in it
they will probably summon some air elementals and stuff
bvc it
maybe shoot a lightning
theres multiple unclaimed thrones
bvc is slow i would rather drop a rock on it and get it over with
literally bvc dangerous mage thrones if you can always
its not exactly dangerous
even if it's "just" for 2 months you can make some of their brains fall out + give some shit battle fright
im waiting for my god to wake up in pankor so i can send an unscripted space ship at a throne and win instantly
lol
a air 1
and 2 air2s
one of which has d3 so shes going ot just make skeletons that my rock doesnt care about
you will probably have 3 or so air elementals poking you that's the only risk
sick the necromancer event chain has started
is ther eany reward for letting him get big or should i just destroy him
doesn't he have a robe of invuln
or was that another guy
also he kills everyone when he pops up in the prov
kills everyone like population or like the guys standing there
the population
sick he can gain crown of despair
so if you wait and let him kill everyone and wait a little more he can generate a d gemgen hat
doesnt he like, rapidly get stronger
yes
and build a castle and shit
the province has like 5 gems in it already
and will get 2 more from his lair
probably let him kill everyone and take his cool house

tfw you do your turn so that you don't have to do your turn.

monkee i am sorry to hear you got owned by a genius quarterback sea troll
but also it is very funny

what is a sea scorpion
i googled it and it is talking about some very long dead extinct thing
monkee can you believe mari didnt name their pg "super marignon galaxy" in pankor
supermarignonation ftw
it is decrepus you can shame him directly
(only fans of gerry adams' puppetry may appreciate, let alone find that name funny at all)
alas
anyway, here's the army graph
!details
this is unacceptable
4th, nice
you'll have to stop building forts eventually
2 ais in year one hell yeah
basically, if you don't have a plan to deal with 300 ethereal units hitting you on every coastal province, you've already lost
income at least isn't a therodos shitshow, the elfs, boars and chinamen are holding their own. but who cares.
abysia's spiteful partisan demonbred are the true spirit of dominions
he is the hero we deserve
i had like 8 assassination attempts this turn
hopefully it will be 4 next turn. hopefully.
huh didn't realize how rich i was
given how expensive my mages and troops are...
cryle, i attacked because i thought you were hiding the graphs because you were winning. i admit that i have been mistaken.
no i was hiding the graphs because fuck you
(he wants to stop fighting you so he can focus on wack-a-mole against my ponymen
i hid the graphs the same reason i invaded abyssia instead of yomi. because i could. because i am dumb as hell. and because i am just strong enough for one of those things to protect me from the other.

so how is the war going with sceleria how can i help i have no idea where he is on the map
!details

the sickle who's crop is stalls
oh man i made my first like 100% boneheaded mistake of the let's play
nice
what game are you lets playing
pankor
rlyeh has rich lands, i'm making bank atm
i guess technically second 100% boneheaded mistake, first mistake was: joining pankor
more forts, more temples
more everything
tell us what you did
jerek i am oyur ally
does theorodos have any s magic at all
nope
just clicked on the wrong commander, so instead of sending the guy with now no army back to the cap to get more dudes, and the prophet with the army to expand into a new province, i sent the commander alone to die and the prophet with the army back to the cap
i have to rely on my godless amounts of freespawn to carry the day i think
the fun part is i have video of myself doing it
how is he not soul slaying every commander you've ever made
you shouldnt be able to move your shit!!! fraud alert!!
that is baby levels of making a stupid lp mistake i'll tell you hwat
he soul slew a bunch of bane lords
the best is declaring war with people for viewer entertainment about 5-10 turns before it would be prudent
i think he gave up mind hunting me because i resisted 9 in a row
you have to think of the fans
i have pre-declared war in my heart, and announced it to the fans
the target does not yet know i exist to the best of my knowledge

carp is not good by any definition of the word
isn't he over two hundred design points
i got rolled by carp bless tc
i am being bullied by abyssia
please destroy him with ten thousand ghosts
does he have anything but his cap left?
i suppose you can't technically siege his cap if every commander you move onto it gets assassinated
ad
he barely has his cap left
actually does yomi get frost father
hes gona get incidentally domkilled by tc, which i take great umbridge at
no
why
they have fuckin snow shoe
frost farker

3 gems to get 1 with 25 hp 16 strength and they fit 2 a square vs 12 gems to get 1 75 hp 22 strength 1 a square
it's a valid point.  the bigger ones suffer from afflictions a bit less and the minor benefits of being bigger.  eventually that line of spells does end in " just make a shitload of sentinels "
big one can live thru an damage better but yes
did you... just seduce one of my slow to recruit mages.  god*damn*

good thing everyone involved, including the researcher, was deaf?
yeah sadly the host stilll has to manually do server stuff on snek
although i've been speaking to naksu about it
might want a !claim or the like command so that hosts can associate themselves with the game details
so that players don't need to try and fish for who the host was, especially when the host might have been knocked out

the people's death match is scheduled in the arena. spellcasting is not allowed and all participants will get to borrow a slave collar to ensure they do not perform magic or run away. as this is the game for the common people, pretender god and disciples are not allowed to compete. any pretender breaking the rules will get to keep the slave collar. the event will take place on the astral plane and the participants must leave now to get there in time. in addition to all the fame, the winner of the game will receive a powerful magic artifact. each pretender god may send one champion and all old arena champions must try to defend their title, defying the rules if necessary. may the people's champion win!

pfft, your moon

is that a real event
yes
that is absolutely ftw

people's deathmatch ftw
now you just need to be able to trigger the fucking thing
oh that's easy
they broke wishing for deathmatch
effect 10042 bing bong very simple
give the event an id job's a good 'un
need fucking #selectevent
i could set it to fire every late winter
powerful magical artifact: champion's sword
who cares boing
they are all bad
the point is it's the people's deathmatch
it owns!
i am updating arena mod when i get home
what does arena mod do
and i will include an event that fires it every late winter, if i can make it work
https://www.dropbox.com/s/klfrh5mdn1ddo4d/arenamod.zip?dl=0 it makes the items not suck
and give gold

i think it's 150g apiece
but i would totally set the people's deathmatch

ewwwwwwwwwwwiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee
can someone test and fire the peoples deathmatch
and see if it even works
sure gimme a sec
lol i forgot i didn't finish this
i hope nothing bad happened
i hope i didn't die
sauro got tired of chasing elves around and sent everything at me
hmm i lost like 4 (not slow to recruit) cap mages this turn
not the best
at least two of which would not have died if i had remembered to finish the turn
the other two retreated into enemy territory despite having retreat provs
or i guess only retreat prov, singular
so i guess that one is on them as much as me
but they might have won with a better script i guess
i'm trying to workshop how to fire this event
can you just make a mod spell that fires it
need to add something to tchampions medal
it's a real piece of shit
i guess if you have no other champ items it's fine
but they all give the same bonuses
<@96715337440952320> i have only been recruiting assassins all game, and i have a lot more of them than you have commanders with your invading force. maybe reconsider?
ok but also all your troops or at least a lot of them just died

okay

they are real far away from me i hope
the nazca player is bad luckily
didn't he put w10 and something something on them
either some str or a weapon
or w10 luck and str/weapon
nrw turn new them
monkee you can't because it doesn't have an id and you can't use 10042 to fire events without an id
however rob usefully discovered that all arena events are linked by code -199 so i am trying to see if i can fire them this way
so my gold mine fort changed from 200 to 253
when a palisade finished
lol
that is one of the few times it's worth actually upgrading to the last for tier even without com point bonus
so thats what
26.5% bonus
it should be half of admin value
half of admin
+ agartha cave lol
seems like its exactly as predicted. and additive
i attacked abysia
sadly ive lost the iron mine so i have much less resources in my capital
im not going to win
ys is on the other side of this water moon
should i attack ys, and also should i lab this water moon for amber clans
ooh, we action happening guys
bandar man eater vs marignon
the nazca / pyth double cap is on big righthand planet on the far right
ys has no glamor right
ys has glamour
i mean
on its morgens
non sneaky
on troops right
what number jerek
not on troops
just on their a3 sorc
i dunno i don't want to open this turn until i lp it
but like
there's an island offshore
near there
you should definitely lab amber clan

that's w2, and there's lots of ocean
well, just found the throne of the moon
it conencts to ocean too
also you could attack ys and win in the ocean because lmao ys uw
on a moon
hell yeah
beast throne coming up this turn
ys has a land fort lol
next to abysia?? ?
i wonder why tf this global event has fired 6 times
lmao
he peaced out with abysia
i assume
some cowardly nap
or maybe abysia is just letting him build a fort so he can have a free fort idk
ok feelings wrt changing the slave collar in the arena mod to also act as a holy water bottle and making it unforgable, and then adding a copied slave collar which is forgeable at b1 constr 0?
so slave collar auto blesses?
idk if abysia comes in here or not
<@159883716758470656> hi i am walking through you to get to the ocean
it is v rude but you know easier to ask forgiveness than permission

just don't pd it and we'll call it even though

am mildly worried about you bordering me seeing as you were rabble-rousing against me earlier iirc
of course i was
i have in fact done so for all of my immediate neighbors except for one
however you have an azi which can defeat a space ship in single combat in your candles so i don't want to actually fight you
well you'll find that i'm actually an incredibly friendly neighbor, despite the propaganda against me
my intentions were made clear.

azi complicates things and makes hurting him hard. where is vanheim i can troll him easier
from last sunday
they were "get everyone else to fight so they don't fight me"
i'm not actually sure
where vanheim is
i do
https://gfycat.com/colorlessfoolhardyamericanindianhorse
i border him actually
the threat of bullying is real
oh, you meant 'whereas'
oh oh
that's the message from last sunday
i am v smart
based on what i see and the hesitancy of your neighbors to attack you can win this game if you can hold your position
since your neighbors are 1) water nation that breathes fire and cannot hurt you and 2) water nation that will get fuckin wrecked by azi
extremely very unlikely
and idk some other coward
just get your blood up
lab indie wizards you find
make lantern, bring cataclysm twenty five turns early and win
slave collar has a niche and that niche is to be the most spiteful play possible in the entire game
it also makes assassins extremely patient

can you not make a spell to point to event 3243
no

ikr
supernova brain: they need to remove events entirely
go home samog you're drunk
im right
they need to make event modding better than the halfassed implementation that exists
samog have you tried the #removeoldevents mod which is simply to put that down with a modname and "end" to delete all events from the game
we have another 2 years or so.
i have not

i was thinking the second but the first sounds good too
its crazy how few ervents are bound to scales
elon musk presents: fissionloop
or how many events are like "this will fire at random, but also 1.5 times more often if you have this bad scale"
great. a 50% increase. nobody can detect that!!!
there are artillery trains in experimental
which are pretty fucking strong. you drive around and it just blows up biters everywhere
and for nuclear powered ones https://mods.factorio.com/mods/gotlag/nuclear%20locomotives
good grief im tired
the events are tied to the wrong scales a lot of the time
just tied to order or turmoil or w/e and pretend events: the scale doesn't exist
which is fine for the mundane stuff, but not for "cap sieged in year 0 lol"
cap sieged by unroutable hundred hp commanders
x4, lol
the ai cleared it fyi
lol
gj ai presumably it just attacked with everything inside the fort which i would have done but preferred to go ai instead of doing

oh i was just looking forward to trying out communions against sceleria's 1000+ doomstacks
marshmaster communions
i was ctis
and i'd finally tamed the rogue ai jotunheim that had been attacking me for like 20 turns
eh 50 turns was maybe a bit early nut the game was pretty much over anyway
it was turn 40 at first btw
jsoh did you see my thug scout in lanights
no
how does hitting glamor dudes to break glamor work, do you have to do damage? i figured it would be enough to shoot some arrows at their shields but maybe not
rip pythium
you hit to illusions i think
and that disappears them
in any case like, a small crowd of markata shooting short bow arrows doesn't seem to rapidly decrease the amount of glamers a group of fomorian infantry has

sir scout owns
how much gold in that province
my attempt at a d2 was rebuffed by rng this turn
will let u know next turn
you will have 2 chances next turn probably
good luck
also reminder to everyone in this game, we're 17 turns away from cataclysm
this province has two (2) turtle villages.
just in case something happens to the first i guess.
also, i accidentally sent an army to the wrong province and lost it. cheers
sir scout is probably going to die to skelespammers because i am a moron and also theyre freaking everywhere
sneak into the backlines
i'm counting this is a victory
oh hey, wasn't sure if we were doing that
<@120675876043096066> thats because markata archers are bad and couldn't hit them unillusioned. if, say you get a crowd of tc archers, they will eventually pop the illusions, but i think the arrow would have to hit (eg not be blocked by a shield) first, possibly do damage

lmfao at the flagellent based marignon bless build in more turns]
339/424 dead flagellents

with a flaming weapons / air shield / blood surge bless. wtf
more flags than longdead died that battle
blood surge flags lmao nice
flags into skelespam very good
well i mean they managed to kill 1/18 of my shadow vestrals
so i guess i kinda took a loss from that?
<@113044892225175552> yeah i figured hitting the shields was good enough
guess not
you have to do damage

lucky fucker. easy clear
also it has a n1e1 site on it exposed

wish it was throne of winter to get me better income
but cold resist on all my mans is cool
and 3 wate rgems=free mercuries
do mercury barrel elementals guard commander
like water bottle ones
because lol if so
oh wait is make mercury ele a ritual?
and are they scriptable?
you can summon them as some nations
i think it's la agartha that gets barrels
i can summon them as t'ien chi
good to know
if you can script them they are probably the only kind of elemental it is still easy to buff
though they may poison your buffer to death
so yeah bane venom doesn't disease dudes in the province anymore?

<@!160127200803160064> lmao what the fuck is this https://puu.sh/zkh6r/d48d1ba45b.jpg
looks like about 100 enemy units, mainly consisting of war elephants, vanara archers, vanara swordsmen and vanara infantries
if i had to guess
why in the world would you have an army of about a hundred enemy units , mainly consisting of war elephants vanara archers vanara swordsmen and vanara infantries
thats an absurd number
probably for stomping on things
if its for stomping on demon things please remember that the spell frighten exists and i will frighten the ephelants until they step on all the monkies etc
tbf i don't think it particularly cares what it stomps on in particular
imo send it to stomp on bogarus since im in the process of doing that myself
at the moment i'm enjoying just stomping on indies but sure
also i feel more inclined to stomp on marverni for claiming that throne like a prick
stomping on indies is good
stomping on marverni is also good
please stomp on not me.
i have a soft spot for bestnation yomi
so for now i shall not stomp on thee
did you like, randomly step on a wizard holding one of the items that make armies look bigger or what
thats an insanely huge army
i did step on a bunch of wizards, but i got no army increase charms
funnily enough i did step on two amulets of missile protection
which is hilariously stupid
!details

much like your posting
rude
anyway i'm happy to make that our east/west border if you want
im going to not attack you right now because i dont want to get stepped on
are you sure, it might be fun
i wouldn't know
<@178868273935417344> attacked me with a scout and defeated 5 pd
i mean there's at least three players plus the ais attacking me r/n so i feel like a man attempting to be crushed
that wont happen
because mages target hp density
and also the ephelants run faster
i love to have about a hundred units, mainly consisting of war elephants vanara archers vanara swordsmen and vanara infantries.
have you heard of my rock band?
assassin's crud more like.. he he
it's called about 100 enemy units, consisting of mainly war elephants, vanara archers, vanara swordsmen and vanara infantries.

i'm pressing butan
to see wtf is going on
hey, what's a good counter to 80 or so burning ones in ea abysia?
lances
rain
also they are ethereal and have a 6ap fire shield
looks like something might be wrong with carto revision, the server is failing to find suitable start positions
a magic lance
related question
whats a good counter to fire shield/blood vengeance bless gath
as ea ermor
antimagic and skeletons
its like turn 12
doesnt the fire shield kill the skeletons
important q: is this on gibbors or levite zealots
i dont think he has made any sacred troops yet
but his god just awoke and gave him this bless
and i lost 4 equites to a kohen
lmao
so i will probably lose a lot more if he makes, like, one sacred troop with armour
well as i see it you have three choices: go ai now, go ai in 6 turns when you didn't research ench 5 fast enough to win, or diplomancing
ok one sec starting this whole mess over

click a fort
lol if you don't take defender wall power into account and take for example 14 additional siegepower on top of all the gate cleavers to siege down ur forts in one turn

also dont talk to me here i hate it talk to me in the chat chahnel i hate the fuckin individual game channels
this is what really sucks about water nations
me and rlyeh have been completely irrelevant the entire game
and then oops btw i'm about to murder everyone
i'd have cast burden of time early in you're position, so cinch the victory, but i'd been prepared to dispel that the whole game, so it didn't really matter either way.
i could overcast it pretty harshly
wisely: badmus
yup, that's what i'd have done too. would have tried begging for astrals at that stage. glancing over the map, and what i know of everyone's available spells, you're the only one with a path to victory that isn't hunker down in you're thrones and hope the horrors destroy everyone elses first

ok
<@282646158218756116> 23 is mine in lanights
i see indies in 27 u can have those
i will not trespass on the tower of books
should i cast winged monkeys on the guy leading 20 longspears around while my army is behind them
its would be extremely funny so yes
it's just led by a regular size 2 guy right
it would be funnier if there was still a guy
yeah its just a commander
barbarian chief
fear decrepus
fear
i get to slither back into my sea now on ice planet
only required some mild trespassing
if you want to win in a particularly funny way, you can probably take the throne of the pantokrater in a few turns, and then you're dominion just crushes everyone with the conflict bonus.
if either that or i dont get to build a lab because i have to put pd into where hes going
also <@178868273935417344> the only thing a bvc does for you now is kill pop real sad
it's the watcher throne next to agartha. if you stick a lightning rod on your god you can probably clear it easy
yes i saw
thats still good
is killing that guy worth 59 rp and 10 gems
i think prboably not
you could probably just pump pd to 10 where he's going and send a lady from your tower of books to make forty bugs
wait do bvcs not disease units anymore???
diseases the guy holding it only
if i pump pd to 10 i cant afford  2 renatus and a lab and 8 mystes or whatever
no boing why did you move those guys there instead of towards me via the plains
wtf
rip in piss scout
also its fucking wolf tribe and longspears have shields
you will have to commit either mages or gold

however, cave grubs are not amphibious
they will just get stunned by my guys who dont cost a hundred gold

or does time stop slow soul drain ticks that'd suck
i'll have to check. maybe just time stop buff fully then soul drain

im watching his sauromatia game
which is great cause sauro was fucking awful iirc in dom4 so its nice dom5 has atleast kidna changed the meta
did you bois get around to banning pan?
no
they were not bad in dom4
also yes pan si banned in every game ive ever played
except la pan
why not la pan
sauro was good in dom 4 but was part of the ea nations that got destroyed by ros club
however if there were no ros nations left and sauro was in the late game they were very good
hoh theres also utgard
i mean everyone else is probably less bad at time than i am

huh, i had werewolves attack and defeat the pd, but all the werewolf leaders died and they didn't route
rout?
berserk?
oh, maybe?
oh, their morale did say routing
well, time to send in a monk
if you route first then it does weird stuff
ive had indies with zero commanders win as well
yeah, i checked their morale and they were routing
how do you see province event history?
i
ahhhh
glad to hear throne of beasts is doing its job
üëç
it cost me ~$50 and the use of a fort for a turn
oh, and a monk's time
dont take this from me
it took a province from ys in abysian territory, so they could probably roll in without causing a diplomatic incident
oh, are there any aqua wolfs that attack underwater or is it solely a fuck you to land?
of course
same as gaia
water is not affected
i do have some land. most of it is very poor and shitty
so theoretically i could lose a prov too
i am unused to agartha not being shit everywhere
agarthas cool now
or. it has been since dom4
boho
once they actually get into the water they can even recruit non-shite wet ones, with actual armour
yeah i played one game of dom 4
thought it was an all ages game and i was jomon and 2 or 3 turns from winning when the game died
<@282646158218756116> okay ill sell you the moon but just think of how damn far those moon warriors had to go to get to you

like not being able to do the indie priest trick is bad but
there's probably still a good way to play them

<:rip:372893660963930112>
lmao. one of my iron angels became a hero! he got... unequaled obesity.
nice
i think something must be done about bugs
because nearly killing a fully decked out angel via small beetles = probably not actually good balance idk
lmao. yeaaaaaaah
harassed penalty ftw
it's not about that, it's that they do 1an damage ie have like a 57 or so % chance to always do 1 damage through whatever prot/invuln anything has
oh
wat
ya
tiny bite is retarded
so a beetle has a better than 1 in 2 chance to plow right through all the magic and do a point of damage
correct
and it does this before fire shield or what have you
so it p much always goes though
through*
and you can summon a horde of the bitey things in short order
yes
there is swarm which makes a quite lot of them
and then at alt 7 a spell called creeping doom which can create literally over 100 at a time for 1 gem
what the christ
(or a mere 65 for an n2 with 2 gems)
as well as being tons of damage they also super fkin clart up spell / unit attack targetting more in dom 5 than 4 it feels like
my immersion
lmao i decided to attack a province, then flinched and backed out, but kept all my mages attacking and they died uselessly
one sec
moon warriors, son.
oh huh
diseased skratti automatically become werewolves if the disease would be lethal
!details

yes
thats how dying works when you are a shapeshifter
and then they never die of disease because they have regen
will be afllicted to shit, though!
whats the maximum # of sites again? 6? 8?
sixty nine
nice
and yeah taking 10% of your hp is the baselind for getting afflicted
along with disease just causing afflicitons
10% of... current hp? basic hp? max hp this turn?
max hp
cool, figured, just checking
which is the exact amount that 1 level in regen heals
which is why diseased werewolves never die
instead all their limbs fall off and their brain turns to pudding
the lowest regen in the game is 5% actually
oh?
does anything even have that, naturally?
champions cuirass i think
is the only thing
oh nope
crown of ivy king is 5% also
and king of mountains
and tartarian spirit
huh
thats a lot of things actually
1 unforgable item, 1 artifact, 1 random unique conj 8 summon, one random conj 9 summon
<@!169456837236621312> my galaxy brain flying monkeys play worked btw
ive never actually cast that spell before it owns
it makes a special assassination battel where you have like 8 flying monkeys with a sleep touch attack and if they put the guy to sleep it teleports them to the caster
does the caster then fight them?
it treats it as the guy who got monkied attacking the province the caster is in
so in this case my pd destroyed the commander
im imagining a scenario where you attempt to flying monkeys a commander
and wham bam turns out the enemy kited them to hell
and then you lose your prov
well thats not correct its , it moves the commander to the place you casted from
so if its a friend its not an attack at all
also if the commander is kitted to hell it will probably kill the monkeys
yeah
they have 15 defence and 13 attack or something tho
so maybe not
its also probaly like drn+1 of them
or 2d6 or something
maybe no explodey
my least favorite part of bot is
the poploss
burden of time should work liek antiunaging
and make the things recruited after its cast have a multiplier on their age
it doesnt even make sense that it'd cause poploss because
children would grow up faster, too
physically
but not mentally
so what you're saying it
do you think a 20 year old whos 6 months old in him brain would be a functional human being
for the purpose of taxes etc
it should give a bonus to
bloodhunting
i wish sacred shroud reduced upkeep cost
by half
he didnt lose cap pd
he also lost an army of patrollers
!details

!details

im gay
jj the implications of burden of time are actually insane
like you p muc could not educate people
and it would be a constantly struggle to harvest and eat and replant crops before they all wilted + everyone just friggin died instantly
burden of time isn't literally making time go faster dude
i think you could maybe make a sci fi/fantasy film about burden of time, the spell
right...
but it is making aging go faster...
hence why education is a problem and so on
you have basically 1 year to live your entire life
you still have, like, probably 10 years to live if you're a peasant or something
no you don't at all mate
5 years/month
4
ulm is feminizing gamers
burden of time should make everyone you recruit after it feebleminded
unless they come out at over a hundred years old
and also , it should amplify the growth an ddeath scales pop growth effect
i'm not sure it would remotely help farm productivity to not even really be able to train people at all and within a year your experienced labour force is dead
it's 5 years a month? i thought it was only a year a month
yeah i thought it was 4 years in 1 year
isn't there an mr roll for "suffered badly"?
nice
i think in growth 3 its like 3.5 years a month or something stupid like that
i am not 100% of the mechanics but i believe it is an mr roll for 5 years and definitely 1 per month
babies do not have high mr
i also consider most normal ass idiot people to have prob mr like 8
you get a bit of antimagic training as a soldier in dominions world i would assume
i guess you wouldn't grow properly either and everybody would have progeri
doesnt a militia have 10 mr
everything would be insanely fucked up mukip and there should be a series about it on netflix made by the devs
hm do you need to eat a year's food every month
yes
maye thats why ppl die
but luckily a whole year's worth of food grows in a month
but unluckily that is not at all easy to harvest
and store
but also it rots and vanishes yeah
and distribute
wog bolts
if your crop goes bad due to disease you have maybe an hour to get some food from somewhere before everybody in the village dies inbetween trying to dig out all the soil and try to plant a new set of crops while withering away from hunger
horrifying!
spooky
pythium is playing "claw back territory from a larger ai" game so i won't be very helpful for anything
basically
fuck tim burden
oh yeah and all the pack animals live for like 2 months at best so eventually society has to rely on a handful of badly educated mages (keeping in mind the mages were the ones who did the burdening) to teleport food around so not everyone dies
it's not quite as crippling to play against as i used to think, i feel like it has a bigger (or at least more immediate) effect on player morale than it does on who will eventually win the game
well
usually whoever casts it
but if you can't start transitioning to a gem-based economy of action you're pretty screwed unless it gets dispelled
doesnt get hurt by it
so they gain continual advantage
depends who casts it
and on their neighbors
sceleria for example gets absolutely destroyed by it
yeah and in this case its sceleria who casted it
as a fuck you before dying
ah see in this other game i'm in ermor cast it twice or maybe three times
and then pan's cast it, had it dispelled, and has cast it again
lol
jbrereton - today at 9:35 am
jj the implications of burden of time are actually insane
everyone would die because there would be no way to have a child.
every human in the game would be full stop dead within one year.
sceleria should get huge amounts of bonus supplies under burden of time
since they have skelemans to farm for them in the lore
!details

ok good i need like two more hours.
ea ermor and ma sceleria should get access to the ma and la national spells, but they're only castable if they first put up bot
i think that red robb made that spell for his magic exploded mod
they should just unlock them at thaum 5 bing bong very simple
should bot be thaum 6
y/n
nn
no it should be like 8
at least partly because most people flip the fuck out about it being cast at all and by that time in the game normally like half the factions are dead
is hydrophobia terminal?
isn't that just an enrage?
idk. i've never cast it
aoe 5, 1 gem thing that reads like enrage
hmmm trying to setup a game between me and a friend but having a hard time
do i put in my own ip address when im starting the server?
okay, i know i'm bad at the game, but is this shit really necessary?
https://i.imgur.com/vkvlcbj.png
that's just jsoh
don't mind him
that was too much yeah sorry
jsoh is a grump
i'd just call you a moron fuck-up
i've never used blood vortex, and did not even know that it getting overrun was bad
because late game is fake and always kill blood
blood vortex was not really great in dom4
haven't tried in 5
a blood global on tunr 60 or soemthing
it's the blood dispel
along with looming hell
is insane that it could be taken down
oh
you meant 'overwritten' you illiterate buffoon
overrun implies someone took the province where it was cast
and that that matters somehow
jsoh is a known illiterate
nah, i was fucking around, because as soon as i went to cast ac  i'd get turbomurdered (i'm p much dead soon as someone looks at me) so i threw up dome of corruption to see how bad it is and my caster got ate
hahahaha
i have never tried dome of corruption
lol
ahahahahaahahah
because the description seems to be saying do not cast this it will fuck you
like, i knew it was dumb
but that shit was incredibly unnecessary
jsoh sucks don't sweat it
yeah. my bad
we're all idiots here
fucking morons
ok i am ded in several games
i'll need ideas for a new one
is there a spell that causes a black dog attack event?
oh wait nvm
thought pankor had turned and i'd been hit by the same event twice in the same province
lol
god damn elmokki hasn't released nationgen for dom5 yet
i still dont know which of my neighbors owns which province in bad because they have the same flag.
i will invade both.
no!
who has the same flag
the mod includes different flags so that that wont happen!
what game?
bad
oh we are doing badnations?
you arent! bazinga!!!!!!!
ur and uruk are the same right
oh maybe
im gonna die in that game to blood vengeance fire shield gath sacreds
have you considered horde of skeletons
i have considered how good it would be to have that research, yes
that's what you get for bouncing my shit a lot
i should have been suspicious when i didnt see your design points anywhere
i would cast fire elemental but giants are fire resistant
who are you boing
im ea ermor
why dont you have horde of skeletons
bc its like turn 15
how is my reserach better than yours
oh you did the dumbass horsie bless didnt you
i have very efficient augur production.
it requires many forts to be operational
im yomi ive made like
his horsies shat all over my gittites
12 yurns worth of mages who cant fucking read books
is there a non-sacred that i should have been making besides gittites, b/c the normal gath roster seems pretty terribad
benjis
the power of quintuple bless equites is hard to defeat with ordinary troops
wow. i thought they were dual wielding daggers not swords!!

they loved to harvest the balls of boys with downs syndrome to experiemnt on or something also. comic book supervillain shit
this was all done without consent or even informing people sometimes :)

line still makes them walk forward slower

ikr
it required some voodoo

hurray
looks like the map was fucked and you have to start and restart the server after pretenders are uploaded, then it works (???)
if you get enough cubes large enough
it is a line
!details

cryle i unironically do this sometimes
jsoh did you check your turn yet in late stage capitalism
theres nothing ironic about a line of cubes.
maybe not the way you do it
a line of timecubes
man this map hahahahaha

a cube is just a really short line
(i'm laughing at my own map that i uploaded)
did it turn again
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
or is it just the one where the mind lord is sieging me now
oh lol i tihnk im dead and the robot just decided to stop telling me about that game on acocutn of
hey <@172216575305187328>
er
not that one
<@190292302785150976>
what does the yomi buff do again
cause
yomi is growing on me
im not the maker of the yomi buff mod
thats <@96715337440952320>
use the incredible new modding powers to give yomi half price labs and temples in mountains
but only mountains not highlands.
in its current iteration:

- restores 100% income to yomi but makes their temples 400g again
- adds 2 new commanders, one a recruit (mountain sage) and one a transform shape for namanari (yomotsu, w2d1n2 spy, swamp only)
- makes namanari comrec 1 / 5 rp
- gives demon priests 5 rp + divine inspiration
- adds 2 new recruitable human units to yomi, a retainer who is a guy who is good at naginatas, and the ritualist who is an unarmoured sacred with a censor (small aoe poison weapon
- adds prophetshapes to their commanders that make them very good pillagers (bandit) / mason (demon general) / domsummon gobbos (bakemono chief) / autosummon kuro-oni (~oni shugo~) and able to recruit an otherwise unrecruitable oni sacred in your capital (dai oni)
- adds slothpower to oni
- re-adds turmoil rec to a bunch of stuff to encourage turmoil, and with end of culture up makes their shogu + dai oni 50 gold cheaper
oh ya and namanari are purchasable in swamps again and there are some extra gold raid events to encourage raid
is stellaris good yet
all video games are bad
hope this helps
ritualist cap only or ?
ritualist not cap only
is notorious software toy "stellaris" good yet
jsoh did all your heretic mages kill you
but relatively high rec points + unarmoured on a faction that does not get good forts without making their prophet do it
also jsoh while your "make their things cheaper in mountains idea is incredibly droll there is of course only the mod command to do it in forests
is there a way to sort commanders by type
as opposed to the current system of what appears to be "date hired"
cuz im getting really really exhausted trying to find the druids in the stargazerstack
no my misfortune burning down the temple in my capital
and having a high dom pretender god stand on my capital
and having my enchanted forests get taken down by blood vortex
is what killed me
have sacred non-priest commanders always been able to build temples in previous doms
not sure about 3 but 4 yes
oh god this map
pretty sure they could in 3
:v
i grabbed one that looked vaguely sane
ea ermor should get to turn to ma ermor as soon as they hit *rolls two d10s* says right here enchantment 1
riidi can i buy that moon from you
i expect good renames on turn 2
its very very bad for me to allow someone else to hold that on account of i have only 2 ways off my dumb tiny planet
!details pankor
yes yoiu can buy the moon from me
how much
fuck's sake, my game just crashed and i lost my turn.
uhhh let me check to see if i lost any troops taking it
not right now tho, i have to go to the grocery store. ill @ you when i get back
there's a way to sort away researchers in the army list
no <@110869804197351424> it will be better in two weeks but still not good
aw man that makes yomi more generic
the correct answer is stellaris is good for about 3 hours
and then you leave it alone for a few months
ck2 was the only good game paradox ever made and they have no idea why (its incest)
eu3 was good...
no
also victoria
forever war on anybody who doesn't
no!
jsoh your final message to the world in latecapitalism was about perfect
kremath the path to being not shite is to be more generic, as a nation imo
i could revert the gold thing but it is fairly crippling
having a foreign rec magic for 1 command point is not generic
and having unique effects for prophetshapes is also not
how the fucks malphas not have prophetshape
b/c doing the destroy the smouldercone to make a ton of banefire puke demons event which is basically a copy of breaking the seal is too hard work for everyone involved
still he should have something

im leading storm demons with a dwarf instead of a vanadrott because only the dwarf can wear boots.
the province has 14 income
i lost troops taking it. mictlan blood was spilled for those rocks.
mictish?
why should i care about your dumb blood
nah
*switches to recruiting giants*
mictec
hey, youre the one who wants the moon, not me
blood moons are more valuable
the price is absurd.
hmmm :checks notes: i see a bad moon a'rising
ten times the province income!!!!!!
i see trouble on the way
im willing to go as low as 100.
are werewolves more powerful on a moon
you will recoup your money within a lunar year
if i have that moon it makes my path towards fighting the evil ys faster
riidi 'ok 150 then'
im willing to go as high as 200 but i will not accept any higher offer.
i will give you 210 gold for that moon
please deliver it to the badnations game for me
how is the coolest map game going?
besides jsoh ive played on this map in singleplayer. i know youre rich. theres mines all over that there cave planet
dont deal w riidi hes an insane person
riidi charge cryle for new turn
i dont need turns
i am in control
theres three mines.
jsoh your mistake was asking
220 gold
ill pay you sixty nine gold and a 12 turn nap
instead of just taking it and mailing him 50 gold or whatever
that's hwat i did except i mailed 23 gold and it was fine
well theres like 20 mans in it
and i dont know what ihis bless is
im sure they'd walk away
they aren't going to sit on that shit hole
ill accept your terms jsoh.
nice
never bargain with jsoh
he just bargained with jsoh
and got sixty nine gold for a piece of shit
pretty good imo
plus, free piece of shit
also im going to the other moon after that one, i will not pay for the other moon so if you are going there maybe dont
its also a piece of shit
but i need it to walk on
it never ends. this freakin guy folks./
if we are fighting the same person it doesnt make sense for you to obstruct me!
whatd i say
never bargain with jsoh
new turn
40 fuckin werewolves
fuck

ez
werewolves are pushovers
are those lamas?
theyre cave grubs
whtas your bless jsoh?
fire shield
and prot
so the woofs will self immolate
cave grubs seems kinda gross
huh, nazca and mictlan have the exact same bless
cave grubs are a pro summon
highly recommended if you own caves
what is it
wow they have 52 hp
ya
and they are real brave
that's 260hp worth of chaff for 8 gems
and they hit very hard
more if you have a good mage
wrong
i miss money
i lied. its true.
cave cows are good too
ranged corrosion
thunderweapons/luck/quickness
mesoamerican solidarity
and cost 4 water gems for 5+, though the paths to cast are tough if you aren't literally agartha
i dont know why you'd ever summon a cave crab
because crabs are cool?
probalby wont spend water gems on cave cows becuase i can isntead make olms
well, i've managed to conquer two thrones this turn
watar
the throne of zeal which sucks, and the lower throne, which gives me 5 slaves a turn
which i can't use
of course i need to actually claim them
also all of the stuff i just took from ys got cut off from income b/c of 9 villains taking a shit hole province lol
an excellent turn from me
four pee dee keeps villains away pretty much
the agarthan commander charged them and died of arrows
a beast throne event sent 51 puppers into 17 heavy cav üò¶
poor puppers?
they are now pupped
the past tense
villainous
looks like dog meat for dinner in <province name> tonight
i had no attacks this turn and my monk was able to scare off the leaderless werewolfs
lol
so what does it mean if there is a mysterious cult and i need to send priests
i did, but it says his preaching won't do anything
it will spawn horrors
well even if you're not lying my deer tribe defenders will keep the province safew
oh, and now agartha is between r'lyeh and ys
who'd have thought the inevitable water conflict would have agartha interceding between them
sergeant, what's the name of this province?
fallen agarthan slope, sir
oh hey i found rlyehs god
i didnt know they made a vastness god chassis
he has been talking about it a lot
can't take it awake
because people were using it to teleport onto other's caps knocking them out instantly
lol
wow really?
i think it may have been hypothetical with beta testers but yeah
make dom6 more like eu4
it's important to core your provinces
*presses the genocide button*
excuse me do you have the diplo gems to change the local culture?
id believe it
ive seen people do that with the dinky little virtue
.to
do we have a command to show the order that phases happen during a turn thing
yes but only in irc.
we could make a channel that just has helpful facts
!details

!details

the ?to from irc is outdated anyway
there was like , two changes
insane.
make a channel thats just the fuckin manual .
you can do that already, by opening a private message window with nuclearmonkee ha ha.
do you know if domspread happens before or after fights
i found cube field
preaching happens before but temple checks happen after
[9:11 am] jsoh: make a channel thats just the fuckin manual .
no we're talkibng about a channel that has useful information in it
the turn order is in the manual!
ty.
shamefur dispray
unfortunately bruce geryk has decided that he turn order being a mystery improves the game and has removed it
does he still even write the manual
god dammit
obs did a really good job of recording the first two seconds of that turn i just narrated for like thirty minutes
probably user error, i think my mouse is breaking and doubleclicks sometimes when it's not supposed to
ah well
guess i will do it again, in summary form
riidi - today at 4:55 pm
sergeant, what's the name of this province?
fallen agarthan slope, sir
is that the one with a bunch of pearls and makes misfortune?
the reference site says yes! why are you spending time site searching and not attacking your thunderdome pal
i read more water margin and got to the part where a warlike gallant nobly avoids being seduced by kowtowing eight times to the courtesan and declaring that they are honorary brother and sister
good strat
it makes misfortune?
lol incredible
nope, misremembering
samog i think i watched that on the tv now
horror marks though
it is quite a thing lol
was it song jiang and his sworn sister or someone else
really
site searching is like opening loot crates
it's in the last quarter
its the whole point of the game
i am about err halfway into the tv series?
lol
i don't think it's song jiang but they could have changed it
which gets much more linear + easy to follow after about 8 eps
ya
b/c the first 3 are like... wtf is going on here
and then suddenly they got an editor i guess?
but yeah in the tv show they swear brother and sisterhood and then within 10 minutes she gets him drunk lol
i think it's the same woman, but a different guy who comes by later
hao
:hao:
where are the hao and bao emotes
i guess they would be completely illegible in discord size
maybe someday nevermore will join a game
uruk is probably free territory many places right now, their armies are busy standing around without commanders in fields adjacent to my cap
baooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
lol
*assassinates 2 commanders* "guys uruks dead"
Â•Ω
Êä•
there u go
Â•Ω !
it's more of a prophecy really
rip
hao
anyway all i want to do in this game is be left alone in peace in like 9 provinces, and also to be bribed by other players to go assassinate someone in particular
i have no intention of winning
<@264039348494794754> hi hello
i am sad that's oceania not ys
lol okay so i worked out a potential use for explosion bless: la abysian pd has a priest in it, meaning that if you take a single point of pd you get one explosionman
mercenary assassin strat
which an enemy raider thug might not be expecting
cause oceania can fight back. peace in are time
i told you you could pay to not be invaded
does uruk have the same 'recruit everything everywhere' schitck as ur?
yes
well a little different
if so yeah there will be infinity commanders
i get warriors and shamen out of forts
i didn't have the money at the time, and if i go around being afraid of being invaded, how will my clients respect me?
but not like n4 shamen or those swamp guys
do i get special guys in swamps
i dont think i have a swamp
you do
you get ur boner tribe
are they good
you get can a d2 pretty easily
and their troops are berserking pillagers
w/ stealth
little on the expensive side maybe, or resource heavy? though that may have changed since dom 4
!unit enkidu
<@96715337440952320>: https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/?page=unit&unitq=enkidu&showmodcmds=1&showmoddinginfo=1&showids=1
they are a touch expensive but otoh they are non fort only which is nice
oh their rec points are really high on the reavers actually
no spoilers plz
hunters are only 16/4/9 though and they're alright and stealthy
but ya swamp = 120g e1d1 (edw)
i assume a thug going against aby would have fr
jbre if you want to leave my cap circle and pay a moderate fee to escape reprisals, you need but ask
yeah, it's still bad
maybe as one of the other ones that gets a sacred pd
i also tested how much of an explosion a propheted gift of reason'd flame barrel nightmare wearing an amulet of vengeance was
and that actually kills stuff, though still not in a huge area
i will never pay your nation jerek
you have got entirely the wrong end of the stick as we say in the hood
la aby takes awake god plus scales
so you may think but a dormant rainbow is a particularly hilarious alternative
your sacreds are a piece of shit. awe can be good on assassin
or other pg blesses
ah well, i suppose a short life of trolling will be all i get in this game
(thank goodness, i can go ai soon)
i just want to find a good use for the explosion bless
other than roleplaying cultivators who self-destruct when owned
doesn't exist
a bless that requires you die to work isn't good
nobody has sacred-by-default-immortals except lemuria yeah?
like it's not even good on spammable sacred ghosts
it's just bad
yes
did you see me asking if my army could beat 40 werewoofs
werewolves suck
they will eat the soft cave grubs though
throne of beasts outs owning
therefore, i'm owning
they have 3 length 0 weapons so they will just self immolate instantly on my bless i think
yes
but they are brave and very many
they will kill some
i got fucking attack reared by indies again
shark tribe
ive found oceania
i feel like i can just invade both of these guys at the same time but that seems rude
and probably wrong
forting that super iron mine fucked me up actually on resources
aurora borealis
on this planet of pankor
in thius terrain
localized entirely in your laboratory
i will look into swamplands i suppose
i have exploding mans bless as ea caelum in a game
attack rear suicide flyers
it's funny
'is it good?' 'wellll'
no, i said steamed campfires, not steamed vampires
i also took resist fire along with it so chain self owning is unlikely
hello nuclear
why do you say oceania  can fight back but not ys?
ys is irredeemably bad uw
the old claw back territory from a larger ai who still has a gemgen global up? yeah, it's unpleasant
i think i've taken out their problematic stacks now, the rest should mostly be chaff
i did that with nazca
except no fire resist
self-own highly likely
the nazca bless is pretty much solved
mekone
i solved it by living where they cannot go
no i mean, the correct nazca bless
and its not fire asplode
whats nazcas beles sin that game btw
pythium is province #20
i scried that shit hell yeah
suddenly 250 troops out of nowhere
!details

fire asplode is probably nobody's correct bless
fire explode bless should be phoenix pyre bless
but it is funny
that would make it funny and good... kinda

that throne covered in watchers is a bitch
i dont think he can stop me
i think i last took out one of those with an army of backline air 3 casters spamming living clouds. wouldn't fancy trying it without that.
my combat magery continues to be the weakest part of my dominion gameplay
one day i'll figure out an actual research plan and so on
for now, its "queu up anything, anything at all"
as siltmod yomi the strat if it is just the watchers remaining is prob "30 namanari with 1 gem casting swarm and then skeletons"
yeah i guess morale-less spam is probably the way to do it
it's the an damage that's important
huh, skeletons have an damage?
no bugs do
ah, the skeletons are chaff for the bugs

some supporters of the ltv, however, accept the thrust of the "corn theory of value" critique, but emphasise the social aspect of what marx calls the "common social substance", arguing that labor power is unique as it is the only commodity not sold by capitalists but rather sold by the workers themselves, whose income tends to a minimum, because they have nothing else to sell. the surplus product is appropriated by the capitalists. alan freeman argues: "this is of course true of other commodities [than labor power] also; but other commodities do not walk around the market disposing of their income on an equal basis with their owners.

beast throne owns
too bad it doesn't reset when it's claimed again
or i'd set up a rotation with jerek
and all i get at the end of it is a 5 income province and the throne of pestilence
hell yes
fuckin' moon skeleton luck man
claim throne of pestilence
another one that doesn't reset sad
funnily this has +death, which will completely neutralise the +growth from the throne of the moon the moon skeletons also have
moon skeletons and moon warriros of mictlan
well, moon and ringworld skeletons
and a little bit of a polar ice cap now too
oh did it actually start you on the ringworld
nah, i'm in 146
but nobody contested the ring world
i think most people are locked into planetary conflicts
and some time soon they will look to the skies ... and see naught but skeletons

does ma mictlan have anything going for it?
it looks really not great
but the theme is cool
yes it is a very good nation in fact
recruit anywhere sacreds
i guess recruit anywhere sacreds are always some level of good
i'm just comparing to the other mictlans
its human troops are usable and cheap, air bless is good nowadays, and its sacreds own
the non-cap mages look mediocre
relative to the era it is better than la if you build blood on your pg
but i may undervalue n?
non cap mages are always mediocre for mictlan
n and s are both good
everything you love about mictlan, except blood
getting into blood as mictlan is extremely very easy
to be fair  recruit anywhere b1 mages are great
oh yeah ma mictlan loses smoking mirror
you have a blood 5 spell that makes more blood mages for a princely 36 slaves, also they're a stealthy scary ethereal commander that brings back the dead

if i talk for half an hour about every dominions 5 turn, and i am not eliminated before the cataclysm, i will probably have created something like 35 hours of terrible youtube footage
nice
step it up dude
this winter i listened to eighty five hours of podcast about a 1.5 million word long web serial novel
the best part of wasting your life recording dominions five is having youtube act as a life wasting multiplier
hm better talk for an hour about every turn
gues what else: i read the 1.5 million world long web serial. twice
was that worm?
maybe i'll start in on that when i run out of renegade immortal
ya
maybe i will start reading real books again
think i might be able to make enough money to eat food and pay rent and shit by writing things on the internet, which seems superior to beating my car to death driving other people's food around
we'll see
my generic commander has turned into a skinshifter thanks to his lycan amulet that he picked up
have you read worm before
he has recieved his complimentary greatsword from the society of werethings
not even a little
this is in a different game
hahaha
are those cursed?
well, its good
the parts of it that are good are very good
yeah i remember you recommending it before, i am serious about checking it out
the parts of it that are bad are almost physically painful, which may be intentional
neat
also it has a sequel or whatever , being written literally right now the guys wirting it now to post it in a couple hours
adn you can talk to him about his process and give feedback and stuff on irc or whatever which is neat and he seems like a swell guy.
that's very neat too
where does his irc live
irc.parahumans.net
on like, a billion channels
heh
okay i can figure it out from there
i dont know if theres one for not spoilers or not
probably not a tonight project though
he gets mildly annoyed if you say him name beacuse it pings him
lol
irc
makes sense
quiet monday on the internet
except for nevermore
yeah, orgy is a fantastic spell, for 1 slave you get big dick satyr, who has 40 leadership, stealth and seduction. he can also summon monster: maenad
oh, and you also get 6 maenads when you cast the spell
the suck worm
this map makes eme want t odie

secrets of the succ worm
in the latest episode of 'burden of time'...
how many sites can one province have
i think 8?
like whats hte maximum site level
that doesnt count buildable stuff hto right
8 total sites period
the exact number is probably in the manual
temples and stuff are not sites
lmao
someone in the ausgbs thread started talking about modpud all of a sudden
in the context of mechwarrior online
i still play that game occasionally
lol
the max site number is probably different in dom5
game keeps hanging when i try to end turn
!details

does perpetual storm cause unrest?
probably. everything does

summary: caelum being eaten by everyone, therodos increases lead on all metrics, and has caelum capital under siege. he also has pinged the throne of the pantokrater (check that one out). also, someone is spending a terrifying amount of gems.
stay tuned next turn, or as long as eyes of god lasts
next turn should be fun
haha what you got planned?
making the reddit face as i dispel a level 9 global
well
has he
*shrugs* it's overcast by even less than lord of the hunt buddy
you be smarter prepping for the ghostpocalyse
because demiurge has just summoned a metric shitload of something...
no one knows
but probably not
there's still more than an hour left on the timer
whoops
i forgot to script my guys
i put a lot of guys in the province though i bet its fine.
did it move out of your dom that had a water breathing bless slash did you have some water breathing effect that wore off
its a water queen sounds like
that wasn't me
i am beautiful good person tir na n'og
caelum decided to pick a fight with yomi while being assaulted by therodos??
some top tier level strategy there
"i know, i'll piss off the scary demons while i'm already being consumed by ghosts"
<@185694323407454218> define terrifying amount of gems
if the formula remains the same, something like 200 gems got spent, but probably half can be accounted for by other players
brewing in the deepest of cauldrons, baffled by the absence of sun.
i'm burning a lot of my backstock of gems in forging shit
not anywhere near 200 gems but that probably accounts
for some proportion
ok, that makes a lot of sense. less apocalyptic than i assumed
i wonder how many of the kings/ queens are out
what's a good bless for bogarus?
in lmao i got all the air queens, both earth kings and about to summon the water queens
in 2001 i don't even have conj8
also rlyeh has 8 wooden statue priests
no bless
make lots of the knights
!details

i don't see any royalty and i'm looking real hard
!details

unfortunately you may be waiting a while, i won't get a chance to do my turn for like
9 hours
oh yea my bad
for some reason i thought queen of the deeps was like an atlantis commander or smth
i thought it got dispelled last turn
gz for taking out ermor btw
!details

new version today or very soon
featuring i think ma mekone
there's some monsterism for ma mekone, right?
yep
i hope its actually good
<@96715337440952320> where do you get your insider knowledge
he's a beta tester
oh cool.
also <@96715337440952320> please make your silt mod edit the descriptions of affected spells so it is clear what they do
it does
i looked at lichcraft in lanights and its still about the caster taking a willing necromancer and making him a lich
heres hoping ma/la mekone makes more interesting use of promotion
compared to ea mekone "hey you're not a slave anymore"
but apparently it's their winter half term holidays next week in sweden so it should be properly out
if they stick to their word and release a beta today i'll leak some deets
based on the monsterism theme it'll probably be a case of the gigantes anti-god crusade having fallen apart in the face of helot revolts and the like
they get more monstrous + bigger over time
and i'm assuming it's the perioci guys who do well rather than the helotes but we shall see
ye easiltyomimod still has the same spell descriptions.
when i looked at the wraith spell.
right time to see if changing the spell names makes it work
sorry about that everyone
thats the stupidest thing in the universe
if they become bigger and more monstrous and eat people like in hinnom i welcome an even greater density of unrest and pop loss events
ok the spell description can only be changed by changing the spell names
thats messed up
ya it's fucked
anyway i'll get a new version up
new spell names might actually be good for the mod
bc its immediately obvious to someone who doesn't know the mod is running that something is different
ok gimme a minute to change the picture
you can probably update the mod mid game right
nnnnno, don't think so
you can
not on snek.earth
i mean the spells do actually work beyond the stupid name/descr issue, that i did test
oh well
thats ok
(hence why there is a renewal thing, because i realised 10130 doesn't de-age like a normal transform)
is de-aging important when you turn yourself into a skeleton and/or vampire
also how does the transformation work exactly, do you lose your paths and get lich paths
you don't
you keep your paths
so you just change chassis
effectively yes
thats good i guess but im not sure i would pay gems for it
rename worm that walks to forverially autocomposticized with the obvious description.
boing if you can cast p much any of the spells you have at least as good magic as the chassis provides, and this means that casters with other paths don't lose out, too
it's good
isn't the main point of spells like lichcraft and worm that walks for bootstrapping up paths
no
it's for making immortal mages to cast things like plague or 99999 bugs/howl without very much risk at all of losing them permanently
ok that too
https://www.dropbox.com/s/fh9i4pyhrcr28rc/silt_v2.zip?dl=0 here is a link; i'll update the one in mods too
https://www.dropbox.com/s/fh9i4pyhrcr28rc/silt_v2.zip?dl=0 <- silt v2
i will probably make one (1) lich
foreverially composted, completely covered in mulch, fully and completely wormicized with limbs fully and permanently transformed into bugs and worms and insects and entirely crawling around forever as worms and grubs and loving it.
sadly i did not do that mu
horrifically grotesque and unable to die and enjoying it.
also with the powerful #onlymnr command it is theoretically possible to add 850 new spells to transform different commanders into different immortal things
what's onlymnr
monster-specific spells without using items that are specific to commanders
only works with rituals, sadly
man that + the transform command is exactly what i wanted for glitch mod spells.
that'll be cool for bugmod too.
i was gonna do a prophet shape where if you prophet a bug queen she turns into a cool immobile freespawn hive or something
you could have a spell some dudes can cast to go into a cocoon.
but that is good too
and come out beautiful.
cocoon with a montag based xpshape
so you could get different results
nice.
the main thing slowing me down is sprites
its much harder to make good bugman sprites than good arab on camel sprites
oh are they humanoid bugs
they are mantis people but they carry spears and shields
at least the shitty workers and drones do
is it mantis only
maybe bug soldiers don't need weapons because they are specialised for battle
there are different castes with different bits taken from various different bugs
i dont have the sprite folder on my work laptop sadly.
do they get mantis shrimps from undersea forts
good idea.
is there a national hero named brundle
<@173950598138298368>  please add deleting/updating mods to snek
i'm an ideas guy.
that is also good
its hard to think of names for bugs.
in terms of #nametype or in terms of just for the units
as in nametype yes
i dont want to do the tired thing of having scifi bug names like chxkik or tkichix
chris, dave, kev, etc.
i'd give them three part descriptive names.
i decided they are culturally southern african but it feels weird to have bugs with names like malebogo and akanyang
johnners/rollo/quentin the bug king
like, how do their mouth parts make those sounds
so they're all named like dark fast claw and large pale swift.
thats not bad
if they're drones.
boing it is much easier than that - simply explain that those are the names their human interpretors give them
hmm do they live with humans
of course, everyone in dominions land does
everyone in ea is shitty humans or has shitty human slaves i guess
elysium = humans with some weird shit going on
mu's idea is also nice though
i gave glitches names like that in glitchmod where they're all like
#addname "colourful complex"
#addname "cracked complex"
#addname "vivid hypercomplex"
#addname "shattered hypercomplex"
#addname "blinding real"
#addname "damaged real"
#addname "twinkling transcendental"
#addname "split transcendental"
#addname "bright transfinite"
#addname "broken transfinite"
#addname "flashing ordinal"
#addname "cracked ordinal"
#addname "jagged ordinal"
#addname "vibrant hyperreal"
#addname "incandescent hyperreal"
#addname "mangled hyperreal"
#addname "brilliant surreal"
#addname "smashed surreal"
#addname "dazzling infinitesimal"
etc.
my idea for ma was that they lose their individuality and intelligence and become a centrally controlled hivemind
and that might work well for that
instead of all the names being drone 271, drone 284
and then someone said in la they should all be infected by cordyceps and i think that's dope
nice.
and become like asphodel with mild growth-based popkill
but i dunno if that can be modded
it absolutely can be modded yeah
nice.
if growth kill pop.
i dunno is cordyceps stronger in growth dom or death dom
you could make a case for both
get this boing
why not both
it's your mod, you get to choose
get this: its like ragha but with death/growth instead of heat/cold
good news
death rec exists
bad news
it doesn't work like heat/cold rec at all
and is just a money thing
so you'd have to do the completely lame fix of site-based recruitment where the sites changed based on dominion
bah
is sa down again
it's possible, but it does cut down on free site numbers
works for me mu
can you update the silt mod in siltyomimod game or will it break teh game
its also on snek so i guess not
all i can update is the turn timer i'm afraid
as i said earlier the actual mechanical elements of the mod work, it's just the name/descr thing being unclear that's the problem, sorry i didn't catch that at the time
i cant believe you invaded me in that game mu.
do you mean the one provice i took from you that was at least two provinces away from your contiguous territories
that was mine by the doctrine of spoils of war.
i cant believe it.
<@178868273935417344> i have acquired death 2
prepare for the new game of the new patch
mekone 2: mekone
i already spent all my gems owning myself
maybe next turn i can alchemize
turns out bless bogarus is b a d
rip and gg
cordyceps la sounds cool
'all manner of fruits and legumes'   another good pretender name imo.
titan of growth and rebirth
why dont pretender chassis have scale preferences
growth titan should like growth imo
statue of order should like order
i should get a discount on my demilich if i choose death3
pretender scale preferences would be dope
boing why doesnt the robot have a kevin command to make pretender names
its not straightforward to scrape all the kevin quotes
did you ask samog to ask the robot guy
he said something about a crocodile

how am i not dead yet
i dont storm without checking what's inside first
<@399465886219763713> your land has so much more gems than my land
rude
also what could i possibly have inside that would more then inconvenience you
we did it, team
the advantage of having all the paths
a single swarm caster
got a spam email that has invisible text at the bottom which looks like an enormous tech support chatlog. wanted to share.
i mean, that's something i could theoretically have but a 3 n master shugenja is a 4% roll
cool that moving magic items onto commanders is still bad.
dominions interface amazing
you can see slightly more detail while moving gems and stuff around but it must remain bad
did you know you can put your mouse on a item and press l and it goes to the lab
nice.
i did not
pretty sure that has been in since dom3
swarm is an n one spell
is this not what people mean by swarm?
no just swarm
its good
alt4 spell
mother of god ...
make 20++ bug n1 for one green gem
if you have alt4 kindly do not place bug gems on all of your troops tia
though my giants will brutally destroy them with a single strike, they would hit their kill limit and shut down if there were 200+ bugs on the field
bugs are small and have good defense skill
wow skeletons are powerful
rip me
i lost my god and all my vanheres and storm demons this turn
to like, 5 horde of skeletons casters
im bad.
lmao did demon gate events happen or something
i'm so bad i should be in detention.
u are v good. you got almost 15 provs by t9!!!
unimaginable expansion rate
i remember one dom 3 game playing as stupid bless helheim i had 29 provinces at end of year one
that was on faerun and i had no real neighbors
<@!169456837236621312>'s personal best is 4 provinces by turn 9 so he has a long way to go.
a hard fought four

me, a sage: three.
112 provinces by the end of year one. yeah, it's this one. my insane pace.
update 5.14c: supply items for throne defenders
nice
did they fix bvc
what's up with bvc?
doesn't disease
did i see something about the reaper tag not diseasing enemies anymore/
it doesn't disease anyone but the guy holding it
i thought it was working in surrounded but bot is also up, i'll ask
"fix for disease spreader not affecting units" is in 5.14c apparently
very good
"less defenders in waste" üôè
fukd up
more waste less steed.
the
i'm as surprised as you are
lmao ok the new ma faction is some sheepherding cyclopedes and humans
the balance + paths are all over the place but fundamentally that is amusing
the other faction which i was not expecting to be ma is basically ma berytos
also they have a cap site that makes people age at half rate
whereas the one that's mekone again is i think complete shit, the one that's berytos has really really good storm + air mage access so i think they might be good
that's my take after about 10 minutes
oh they also get an absolutely bitchin dominion effect which is called dark vessels, which is an unlimited size boat for their commanders inside their own dominion
<@96715337440952320> is ma mekone the long awaited sacred goat fielding nation!?
sheep
fucked up
feels like reaper shouldn't disease the holder
there's at least 1 devil with the reaper tag and they aren't immune
the game is somewhat funny about diseases and demons
oni can literally reform their body from their raw soul but will still have lost limbs/be diseased
dominions early game: some men with spears attack your province.
dominions mid game: some men with spears attack your province. behind them, a wizard throws fireballs.
dominions late game: the sun goes out. all your provinces are simultaneously attacked by screaming flying skeletons made of metal. the sky rains blood and your people all spontaneously die of leprosy.
<@96715337440952320> are there sacred sheep
this is important
i'll have a shufti but it's not looking good so far
i have lost the ability to feel human
because of the restraining order
no sacred sheep, swans
sad
at least ill always have boars
whatever happened to the british empire mod?
brexit
the natives destroyed it and then they self owned repeatedly
i want to see a domkill blood nation
that sounds bad
my horror nation is exactly that
pick blood on aspho's pd bing bong very simple
is ma azothia domkill
yes that
domkill unrest generating blood nation
i like the float cat god
that horror marks (cap only)
i want the smerv
i feel like these guys are going to get owned in autumn or maybe winter
also love the idea of completely shit prec undisciplined ungulates patrolling the land
can't believe the throne of goats has been ported into the base game.
it owns
mekone is, so awful, in both eras lol
ma has sheep
therefore it is good
does it make regular sheep
their cap only unit in ma is a worse version of an ea gigante stat wise but also without a shield and with worse armour
(still not sacred)
cause i want to trigger the dragon attack intentionally, as often as possible
https://i.imgur.com/u6lrmnq.png?1
throne of goats ftw
ok their shepherds it appears from 2 turns of testing only make mouflons
and don't even domsummon sheep
i am noting this down disapprovingly for my day 0 balance/more good + fun mod
as well as telling iw ofc

good, good, ma mekone retains the piece of shit troop that refuses to be led by a mere human feature, but also starts with a human sized commander
is mekone an elaborate troll?
mekown
i dont htink theres anything elaborate about it
there is nothing elaborate at all about what a troll it is imo
just "sparta sucks and we made it into a bunch of factions which are bad"
there is a small redeeming feature for ma mekone which is that their research is not extremely overpriced, and they have death on their cap only gigante
however the faction is p much begging to get taken turmoil/sloth 3 in a game where those are a death sentence for your nation
ok their cap only important mage is also a berserker, lol
do they balance with mp in mind? a lot of the time it feels like they dont
of course they balance with mp in mind, that's why every time jk loses to something it gets much worse/more expensive (see wot5e at 35g each)
i nee urn

"yes, the famous youtuber :smuggo:"
not my fault you fuckers. when i made this it was just for testing it wasn't hooked into customer accounts
and they wont let me change the username
if i actually had someone recognize the name i would have to play the lottery immediately
lol
im just glad it wasn't obscene. when i made this i was like 20 something years old and i would name my stuff random shit sometimes
ah yes cisco user idiotfucker69 how can i help you
cause when you join a company and have to manage their shit, they need your cisco id to authorize it
idiotfucker69, vip
being bad at dominions
and elf fighting
thanks to you, i'm now a little less bad because i played dominions for years without ever noticing the synergy between having a flying army and a mage with earth magic. but when you imprisoned me in my cap, i suddenly had a lot of time to think about how to break out

massive possible agartha buff next patch
they are thinking about making boulders not utterly crush people's arms to bits but leave the rest of them unscathed, to help phlegra which is the ma mekone piece of shit faction
but more importantly to help ea agartha 30 range boulder meme bless
did you know that you can't change apple account ids without phoning up tech support?
so yeah, when i signed up as mr. fuck you to get rid of the annoying popup then work made me sign up for an ios developer account a year later...
lol
psst, can i have some turns
that's what the nice indian lady on the phone said, too
lnao
aoe 1 boulders plox
more like phlegmgra
correct
if they make boulders aoe that will be insane
aoe things cannot be blocked or parried
without shield prot it is pretty much not possible to survive an agarthan boulder as anything smaller than a giant
holy shit <@275205678010859520> that was the worst battle i've ever seen in my life. all my good units surged forward while my chaff and my mages stood at the back doing nothing. then your archers spent several turns shooting your god in the back.
they are not making them aoe
they are giving them (probably) the same "always hits body" code as aoe has
hopefully they fuck it up and confer cannot be blocked with it
i just wanna see six markata get squished by a single boulder
welcome 2 da pebel pouch meta

im just glad that bvc not diseasing units was a bug

he attempted to form a union at the hyperfactory and had to be fired into space as a result
space "rollercoaster" promise: fullfilled
i have had bvcs parked on ea ermor's cap for several turns and i didnt know about this bug
it'll still fuck ea ermor's day up since they rely on 46 rec units
frank stringini did the artwork for roger ramrod
by that point i'd summoned enough skeles to route the chaff and the mages at the back
apparently they rely on having 5 horde of skeletons casters that my sophisticated elf/demon based army is completely unable to deal with
have you considered using the powerful "swarm" spell
which absolutely devastates skeletons, and more things than just that
maybe my n2 god could cast it but he died to skeletons because he's a berserk dog.
if you are elves though
where is your n1
im vanheim
or are you the other kind of elf
fighting skeletons is just vanir those things you have to deal with eventually
i should cast air elemental
did they fix the bvc bug?
air elementals are a piece of shit in 5
really
what changed
yes because they are very easy to bring to 0 defence, and they proc attacks every time they encounter a new square of things that hasn't attacked yet
in fact i might bring that up
it might actually have been the 50 turn limit
how can you tell?
oh well thats good i guess bc they were stronger than every other elemental before
yeah unsurroundable lots on all elementals might be good
air especially tho
is trampling in general worse now
trampling is in general more dangerous for the trampler
however
rip la ctis freespawn chariot strat
it is hard to completely fuck up by being 1 square off setting up
which is less swingy i guess
also ctis freespawn chariot is still v plausible due to only proccing 1 set of fresh attacks per turn
<@230792589580697600> are we actually forever warring
shit is
why is that
boing did you consider casting a magic like wrathful skies
and deleting all of the skelespammers
(and also all your vanir)
or, black hearted shithead ponymen
if you have w10 a vanjarl on the chad script of attack closest with a water bless thing or a shroud will kill a mage before it can act
black heart is a nice idea
it's excruciatingly frustrating
if people start retreating out of nowhere
ponymen are bullshit
the virgin communion. the chad script.
they just zip right up to the guy and kill them instantly
it might be too late though
30 blood slave honour guard for every important mage vs vanir
you can also do this with pan hierophants but you have dryads so lmao
depends, are you going to give me my throne back and 1,000 gold to compensate for the palisade?
<@282646158218756116> i'm appreciative of "male seeking male personal, master of disease"
lol
that's a pretty good ephitet
how's that different from a good old hp route
this guy thinks palisades cost 1000 gold.
wait their morale will still be high first right?
this guy thinks the time value of three scout turns is 400 gold
whereas if it was a normal route it'd all be v low
those  pygmies really let machaka down in melee
i'm not giving you back your event cancer throne if you're going to claim it

thatvideo really stuck with me
well, i'll take my turn in a sec
but you're shit out of luck with tnn
elephant eating another elephant's shit is a good pretender name
no im just pro monkeys and boars fighting and rolling around in dirt
jbrereton did you suggest the warning about ending the turn with a commander who can't breathe in his prov
along with the other warnings
it's okay, it just means i have to roll out my secret weapon three turns early
no fuck you. having that warn is against the spirit of the game
p.s., the secret weapon is boars
also i appreciate that steam puts my screenshots as my background for the game
having a nexus caster asphyxiate in a game, eliminating me instantly was the highlight of that game
so now i have the mega-seduction screencap as my background
i was screaming at my father to stop and hitting him in the face with a can but the can burst and the spinach spilled into his mouth and it just made him even stronger
it is different from a good old hp rout in that it can happen to for example immobiles that are doing some kind of abysmal cripple fight with each other

meanwhile, forgotten shithead nations just get whatever indies fall into the pile of garbage
this is the turn
i least wanted ot play
leave ure posts out of this.
oni shruggo
arcoscephale gets mounted commanders as a national commander type cryle
its generic
it needs a greek name
herodude
hierodude
sure let's waste an id to call them a hipparchos
wtf was that
my melias just melted to the watchrs
yes yes
they had copper plates!
:bison:
watchers r scary
no, don't use the id. we might run out!
are they adding a ma berytos
although tbh i wouldn't put it past illwinter to have a 6 bit field
they're, cryle
2^10, even
link
holy shit the therodos battle at the throne of the pantokrater
there is no link binch
link me now
take my word for it i'm a beta tester
how bad was it
i am so salty
.!.. there's yer link
gimme death numbers, i enjoy other's misery
i'm still watching it on max speed
i'll give you the deets for free

i mean, you killed the watchers
still one berzerk hoplite left
it's a cheap outcome for me
so thats something
so it's ma berytosparta?
you're a beta alright
what if... we combined the worst aspects of berytos and mekone and made a nation?
there's ma berytosparta right
and then also just ma mekone
but it's called ma plegma or what have you
oh it's actually two nations net
the watcher routed and disappeared to 1 hoplite!
ma smegma u mean
ma berytosparta is actually good beyond its kind of shit human troops, like the original
good hoplite
now how do i take out the fucking monolith with basic troops
doesn't have blood but has very good air mages and a cool dominion effect that means they can always move infinity stuff on magic boats
my melia's went rip
as well as being sailors with smaller boats normally
berytos with no blood sounds epic ftw, frankly
recruit more melias and finish the monolith before yomi finds that throne
--blood ++air is okay
++ air and quite a lot of + astral
they are pirates
they aren't pirates
do they still have beryto's national summons
finally a pirate nation
make pirate nation
the pirate nation is jomon
that‚Äôs ninjas
nation with hardcoded island start
jomon is the dumpster fire natio
it's both
yes much like pirates
ninjas can‚Äôt be pirates it‚Äôs against internet memes circa 2003
they don't get berytos' stuff at least for now monkee they're more similar to pelagia summonwise
they have what appears to be a summer summonable only f3s3n2h2 mage with all sorts of awe and ethereality and so on
called a hesperide
(f3s1 35f gems)
are there any good cheap summons. i don't care about vanity garbage summons
like a 10 fire gem dude that's a fucked up tiny version of that
so yeah, turn report: caelum busted out; throne of the pantokrater now defended by single monolith; maverni facing a coastal invasion, and a small army is moving in on the throne of creation.
so far, and keeping in mind this nation is described by iw as not yet finished and they'll git er done over the winter holidays next week, there aren't
my dom is about to link up across the equator

the secret to boars is taking a hellscalles+++++ bless and rolling the ice on not being invaded and also having dumbass newbies send you a hundred n gems
oh shit im sending someone n gems in mekone right now
the secret to boars is not going 1) make boars 2)
because eventually, someone will produce a unit that is size four and can tank infinite boars
this one in particular can also withstand meteors and has thirty six mr
nice ill play
the secret to boars is - larger bless
i will play but you hav eto un ban pan
what if.. you make your boars larger with the
oh no
he has large bless
in that case he is undefeatable
by even the powerful buffalo
need bot to recognie my game first
father illearth says lmao size 4 get real
why would i ever allow pan
so i could play pan
ma pan is merely op instead of the lmao wtf ea
you can play asphodel and be grateful

sadly ma pan has to actually use gold ot purchase forts
a significant weakness compared to ea
yeah, you're graphs are pretty good atm

hmm i've never played ma man
is spell singing legit
they are good now
ma man has national communion spells
if they can actually cast yet they're good
didn't they fix that last patch
no idea, i don't play ma man
im gonna play man with the powerful warden bless
probably
don't warden bless in ma. they don't have xbows
it's just an idiot with a 2h sword
ah but monkee
the bless also applies to the dauntless cu sidhe
a yes the large green dog that sucks dick
your national unit is the large beetle
oh their sprite looks cool but actually their stats are shit, thats bad
should i start pretender upload
in la they put an xbow on and are actually worth buying if you have a pigu bless. not as a priority, but to raid with
and pigu also provides n which you need as la
fucked up than la doesn't get a teleport capable priest natively

yeah moms are good
eriu is script 900 sidhe lords the exact same way, sometimes park fir bolg on a place
sometimes use one of their tuatha to cast storm i guess
you can lead some foresters with them and sneak around like an idiot ponyman and be extremely annoying
they have forty leadership and though foresters aren't that great, they can raid easily if you just drop some bugs or howl or w/e and walk around
hmm ok
i will master the way of the bug

oh i have to do that ok.
with your logrian wise men
foreign rec feels really annoying in dom5
yeah you don't lean as hard on logrians
however you are man so you have 1 com point monks who still fucking own
!details geneva

how do monks work
is it bonus rp per candle
it is as many researching at a time as you have candles, max
they are also extremely convenient leaders and scouts and so on for 25g
3rp each for 25 gold
and they are holy so it's 12.5g unit for maint calc purposes
you need to upload a pretender first for some reason
that seems technically gold efficient but it would take ages to get value out of a unforted unlabbed temple with them
???
your temples are half cost
really? sweet
your temples are 200 gold and they are the same price as an indie scout for doing indie scout things + more
monks are legit good
ok thats good.
yeah they are stealth you can scout too
they are stealth, they have some leadership
you should have like 2 temples at least making them monthly for basically the entire game
the only thing on the nation that is just a complete waste of time are the bards
do i rush alt4 basically for wind guide and bugs
bard is a communion slave now
now that they commanion, you can always get storm on their cap onlies which is a big and positive change for them
yeah ok but so is a daughter for slightly more than half maint cost and better research
though they cost moneys dont they. i guess if you have no temple in a place because you are very dumb
and forgot your temples are 200g
damn i thought bards were seducers
nope they're not troubadours
if they were seducers they'd be broken as fuck a la dryads
just a guy who regales, and does 7rp of research
ya
they arent as good though bc they have a dick
guaranteed assassination attempt vs 95% of stuff
they still kill
with 1 nature gem that is quite a likely kill
i guess since they are spies you might maybe, maybe want 1 if the thrones are on medium hard mode
so you can see what the thrones actually are before attacking
heads up, any flying nation will fuck man up unless you specifically try countering them
good job nazca is banned
if you know how to position well, man actually fucking demolishes flyers
ok im making a pretender
ma caelum, while trying to make a fort in year 0 "let's err attack the longbows faction that can easily fucking own us by positioning at all"
because longbows at point blank are going to shred zotz or condors or whatever the fuck
esp since longbows have quite good combat speed and are actually good at hitting
it's just a pain in the ass to position the protective layer if it's something brutal like condors, but you can totally win
with longbows, defended by longbows
ya
longbow shame cube forever
is pig god a good choice
oh hell ya
pigu is still undercosted as fuck
or do i want better paths
it is the #1 primo choice if you can take it on a faction
longbows are good but importantly
are they union members
they are i believe 13 gold so i'm saying yes
no scabs
good
they are actually 10g 7r
and have 12 prec
they...
reduced the gold cost of longbows?
that is insane lol
lmao
what. i thought they were still 12
stat fixes my man
what the fuck illwinter
ok you now officially have 0 reason to get a spearman as man
elon musk builds the euthanasia coaster and "offers" all pro union employees free rides
attack skill 10 defense skill 11 longbow with 12 prec for 10 gold lmao
also, it has a sword not a dagger
just 15 cubes of longbows so fliers get paralysed by choice and die
it's ma only. la is still 12g
ok but la still has 10g xbow right?
it's probably from the tons of people going "waaaa ma man is weak" because they don't know how to leverage nature
hows this
report it as a bug and watch the la cost get reduced
yeah xbow is 10g
you want order but sloth
i think
its a powerful warden bless, jbrereton
you run a bit heavy on rec as la man
i'd tank heat for magic
also why not go hot 3
ya
does magic affect monks
since they arent wizards
i don't think so but it affects your everything else
nice intuition
yeah idk why bug is freaking out
hes clearly in #1 spot
i believe it does but am not sure; more importantly monks are a supplementary source of research not your main guys
also if you were cool and popular you will take m o r r i g a n a
morrigna w/ vamp lord paths
perfect
if you sink about five hundred design points into her you can have an awake expander who is very strong and can be split up as you gear them
she will almost never die shamefully to heavy cav
i want to be cool and take the chad morrigna but i will play it safe for now.
pigu is the objectively correct choice

i'm going for the poor man's quickness
2 x swiftness, blood surge, withering weapons, defence skill.
withering weapons seems bad
unless it does comparable damage to death weapons in which case death weapons seems bad
i just kinda want death access for end game
and it's not incarnate like most weapon mods, so i can imprison my guy
withering weapons is good
and death weapons is shiiite
does withering weapons have a nonzero chance to decay someone's god to death
forever
yes
dunno but my valks will be going straight to mage lines with it
i also considered undying * 4, didn't seem quite as good
valkyries would be good if your vanjarls could wear boots.
im getting triggered into oblivion by the #polygetmagic command
you can recruit disir boing
who fly
if that is super important to you
quickness is +2 attack/defence, + 100% movement and double attacks. swift + blood surge + defence is +3 attack / +3 defence, +60% movement (with probable first attack) but no double attacks
and i don't have to take incarnate
big advantage of quickness: only using your piece of shit javelin unscripted for one round before they're both gone
this combo is 160 points cheaper

possible transform shapes: mouflon, goat
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/015/266/z7herxu.png
oh yes disir exist i forgt
p much everything is an ironic transformation punishment shape in greek mythology isnt it
minmay is the worst thing to happen to crawl, and he banned me when i called him out for being shit and having shit taste
!details

have you all had the opportunity to
play goon crawl?
it only took forever
!details

elves are great
and bug is shouting about other people as much as possible to distract us from the fact he's winning handly
yes, it is much better
because we removed minmay
polygetmagic sucks as a command
you can't use it to innately reduce magic paths
so the evil cursed giants turning themselves into a mouflon still have like f4e2d1
appears not to roll for random paths either, which, boo
wtf how long can a goat be 318 years old
fix
lol
can we get a chasis that randomly transforms every year?
start taking his shit i guess?
i suppose anything under my dominion is technically my land
mouflon is a valid transformation result right
probably the best part of the patch if so
mouflon is a valid transform path if you make a polymorph spell with it as part of the montag
you could absolutely get a chassis that randomly transforms every year, you could do it every month even demi
how do you remove a pretender upload from the server
no mean is it tagged to be a result if you cast the spell transformation
they removed the other cool shit like turning into tjatse. i demand to at least be able to turn into a sheep (giant)
i believe it will not be since it is specifically called a phlegran mouflon
however it is extremely easy to make it a valid target
#transformation 1 = good result
and then maybe give it natureattuned 50 or what have you
hmmm i cant connect
please suggest it in the beta forum tia
also idk if swan is valid, but that should be there too
<@170661706421370880>  if you would like to code this abomination of a monster what you'd do btw is xpshape 1 into a creature with a montag'd nextshape as the whole array of units
+1 blood, due to the amazing blood rage of a swan
oh you have to make the entire line?
but then it wouldn't be random
let's debate the meaning of "randomness" when it comes to a computer
everything tagged with a montag has an equal chance of being a target
is this insufficiently random for you
if so feel free to literally double the amount of monsters in the game so they all have valid xpshape 1 monsters
(b/c since you cannot target xpshape at specific ids this is how you'd have to do it)
a stale bandar log... why couldn't he be my neighbor i ask you
being able to transform into the jotun hero was the second best part of transformation
the best part was transforming your god into a brain damaged ant
i just have too many dwarf hammers! pm me to buy some
jsoh + i workshopped the best possible transform bless which is larger + recup
thus allowing you to turn your irminsul into a size 2 fly and even recover their brain
new pank new pank new pank
that's incredibly powerful
who even has sacreds that you would want to reliably transform
is there a smaller bless
i want to turn my god into a size zero ant
sadly no
oh lmao ma man
crone's arent that expensive
but with recup bless you can use improbability drive for diversity
super fucked up that cave grub is not a valid transform targetg
monkee it is for your god not other lesser creatures
whynotboth
ant is stealth 40
i did it in that one ea ulm game remember
very strong pg chassis
with the good ettin
also i would say maybe la tc
b/c spirit masters can go from being old to not being old, and you can twiceborn them if it all goes horribly wrong

somebody tell me how to beat 80 triblessed condors. tia
so far wild hunt got some wolves murdered by a shugo and killed a single 2/turn recruit anywhere h1 priest
so
i'm guessing the lord of the hunt is more impressive
90 tribleblessed condors
don't you have idiots with the same kind of tribless
also why the heck would he attack tribless mictlan instead of someone easier to kill
oh my god lmao condors have shock res 15
is that real or is mod inspector on acid
cause if they have shock res you just get fucking dumpstered and uhh there's probably nothing you can do about it. maybe use large pd traps?
oh you can sleep them. condors have ass mr
pd traps with iggles in the middle and guys casting sleep cloud
why the fuck do condors have fifteen points of shock resistance
because fuck you
i guess it's intended that nazca can cloud trap their god into a battle and t1 wrathful skies on top of their army and defeat basically anything until turn fifty
except like an sc god with stacked shock res
skelespam? dies. giants/whatever the fuck? dies
herne is a rapist full stop
im glad he can only appear one place at a time
nazca is fucking broken
tribless nazca is attacking tribless mictlan with identical blesses. i assumed "oh you'll be fine you just need to trade sacreds with him and play carefully"
but uhh, they don't care about shock weapons so he just dies instead
pankor?
yes
rip
sleep cloud ... hmm ... thats a good idea
what's our plan for that
mine is be in the ocean
yours is probably "have shock resist bless"
and fire shield
is it quick luck thunder
isn't that what they both took?
sleep cloud would be pretty much the only route i think
cause if they are asleep and being lucky they will continue to sleep until the fatal blow lands
well o have the powerful combo of being under water and  shock resist fire shield
the last like 4 sectional ns of this orientation just dudnt work
hmmm
maybe i should march a hundred pale ones and my sacred doom stack to just decapitation strike nazca
they are coastal right
fighting nazca fucking sucks though
250 fort tho
even if you don't get owned by thunder weapons those dumbass burds hurt, a lot
i can one turn pop their cap
you have to get there first
do you have statues already
it's not that hard to flame ward a blob of condors with inca
hey guys, i wanna bow out of this game but i don't wanna lolai
if the guy plays anything like me his cap will have not many mans
i should make statues not earth elementals right
yes
gimmie water breathing toys for my magma kids
how do you get 5 for 2 gems
bot is good
.is samog samog
i dont have make water breathing technology i only research spells for my space ship to cast
ill have that like turn 35
luckily my bless doesn't let my dudes stun lock birbs either on account of theh have infinite shock resist
but you have fire shield don't you and condors are solid length 0 so unless he fr buffs they will self own very hard on statues
yeah
and they won't particularly harm statues unless they are strength buffed
how do you get enough gems for 90 condors
easily
it's a scaling spell and he has an awake a7 god
ahhhhhh
ok
you get shittons of them, forever
i didn't realize it was scaling
yeah ok

you are just supposed to be able to assign game roles!

i can also do that
making this channel colorful is not abuse
like that
<@184675842432040960> why would you say such things
and besides, humans first
lmao
yay
its because you have the mall cop role and a color role
the people of mictlan may be backwards but they're sitll human
the color role is higher, and doesnt let you add roles below it.
but the mall cop role letting you add roles means you can add colors below purple
discord sucks ass
loool
yeah i might be able to mail some gold or gems to support the war on nazca in a turn or two if someone wants to clue me in on the tactical situation via pm
yeah the only colors i can add are the 2 below purple

good shit.
there's a whole rainbow blocked off for me
the tactical situation appears to be nazca with a8 and 2 capitols produces a lot of gems which produce about twenty times a lot of condors

casting gives you the portal projectile status, or refreshes an existing status, with a duration of (3+random2(floor(power/2))+random2(floor(power/5)))*10 aut, but no greater than 500 aut. this adds random2(floor(power/4)) to your to-hit
the crawl devs are insane
5/18ths of the imps are white. otherwise, if random2(power) >= 46 or a 3/13 chance succeeds, you get an iron imp with a 1/3 chance and a shadow imp otherwise. if all of those chances fail, you get a crimson imp.

the description for stygian paths makes it sound bad. is it bad.
its good
but bad.
stygian paths is extremely dangerous but also kind of owns conceptually
imagine if astral travel had an mr or die component mu
that's stygian paths
is it something you never use except in the most desperate circumstances.
if you don't have thaum 9 for astral travel / don't have s5 mages on your nation it can be sort of useful but it can also be a real pisser if a bunch of the troops you were transporting die
undead aren't immune to the mr or die effect, either, so you're looking at like 60-80% longdead casualties every time you use it
dumb.
undead and nonliving should be immune imo.
agreed, maybe i will suggest this
!details geneva

mu if you are ever in the mood to mod again and want to use #polygetmagic 1, one thing that does work in terms of reducing magic is negative pathboosts on the thing you're transforming into
just a tip there
only the finest armies in mekone
what's polygetmagic 1
it's a polymorph (effect 10130) add on that means you get the base paths of what you turn into
cool.
also what i wanted for glitch mod.
ya it's good you just can't reduce paths with it, which is a shame
and you can't give things afflictions automatically with #startaff with a polymorph effect

is the modding manual documenting all of these new commands btw
it doesn't even have all the dom 4 commands in it m8

but stuff like #haltheretic which was added in a dom 4 patch for example is not in the manual

they're so bad.
i still somehow outlasted man and patala

that would only be amusing if they chose the devi of good fortune chassis
also one of the issues with signing up for <@159883716758470656> 's game is that he bypassed the bots lobby system and just moved into pretender uploading on snek immediately
and it's the lobby that saves era and players etc.
ah that makes sense
btw <@255835336083636234> is it a feature that the bot spams me multiple times a day about my turns, or am i special

i'm getting that too
i believe thats because the bot is restarted multiple times a day and when it starts up it checks your turns and will ping you about turns that you've not taken yet even if it already pinged you
i believe "stop it doing that" is on gonadic's to do list somewhere
i at least made it so that it doesn't ping you if you've done your turn. i don't know for sure if the crash is causing the problem or of its something else but it's fucking annoying to fix a crash that sporadically happens every few hours
it is on my list though yeah.
instead of fixing it can you make a bot command that will ping every player in a game about their turns if they havent submitted yet
right next to "teach how to open doors"
so i can spam samog to do his turn
it's super weird though because when it detects a turn on the server it should immediately update the db with that turn before pinging players
so even if it were crashing it really shouldn't be saying "hey a new turn not in my db" multiple times like that
could always have it md5 hash the game name + turn number and then compare hashes
mostly because i love overengineering probably simple problems
but still
that seems like overkill
but then i made nevermore store quotes and tags and custom commands in a custom xml format instead of just using a fucking csv or something

ok cool
what is the actual cultural inspiration behind the machaka nation
besides just 'africa'
the animal totem thing is straight out of west african folklore but the nation otherwise seems to have much more in common with, like, zulus and shona
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/machaca    hope this helps.
```machaka is a nation inspire
d by african kingdoms and the shona 
in particular. the king, a sacred figure, 
reigns, but does not rule. he 
is served by vassal chiefs, and h
is priests, the eyes, ears and mouth, keep 
constant surveillance over sub-
chiefs and serve as a link betwe
en the people and the temple. the shilluk 
concept of regicide and other uns
pecified ideas from african cu
ltures have also made their way into the 
nation. modern oriental concepts a
nd fantasy clich√©s can be fou
nd in the black sorcerers of the god 
mountain, and the spiders. i admit 
to some obscure influences f
rom the comic the phantom as well.  
the machaka of the early age
 is influenced by the old pen and p
aper rpg 
powers and perils
. in the 
fantastic campaign setting of thi
s game there was a nation of a
frican stock led by great men that were 
released from a great sleepi
ng city. the notion of a released r
ace of superior men was attractive.  
various myths, tales, films and "african" fantasy concepts have
 been mashed together and mixed with 
the middle age machaka ideas.  m
y first idea of clans based on 
body parts like liver, heart, hand, head 
and leg, did not feel right and was replaced with animals, more
 fitting with the spiders
 of the middle age. 
the nation evolved side by side 
with berytos, bu
t it took a bit
 longer to finish. creating two nations 
together and intertwining their
 history gave them both addition
al life. it is probably something i want to 
do with more new nations in the future. ```
hm
ok that quote got fucked up
lol
it helped me, mu
okay added some more debug code that should help me figure out what's going on
do the horrors show up one-at-a-time, and only lesser horrors at first, and then ramp up?
i think theres 4 horrors max but not all will necessarily show up in a single turn?
but i don't think it ramps
but i could be wrong, never gotten that far before

idk
an excelelnt combo
vanheim should name their disciple year four thunderstrike
i can change nation what meshes good with van?
eriu
it's fine actually. ulm doesn't have to take tstrike
most everything works okay with van
if you give van hammers immediately and he makes lots of quills it'd be ok with drain probs
oh you did reanimate + fireshield?
or are your assassins fire shield casters
tired: giving van hammers
wired: van forging imp familiars for ulm to further boost their research rate so they can send 1 gem lanterns quicker
üëÄ
yeah there's also that
hahaha
just let van get const2 and grub around in the mud struggling to rp
and feed ulm quills
it might be a bug based problem jerek
im vanheim in a game and you'
are giving me flashbacks of y1-3
reanimator + fireshield plus some general stuff
yeah i thought i tested it and it worked on human bodyguards
to stop people getting 5000 little soulless every time creeping doom gets cast
my condolences, i have watched literally 0 assassination battles or even actually any battles
basically any game where you are a heim where age is != la you should get quills+hammer pretty much instantly
because you will be super fucking far behind otherwise
i have been killing a lot of your stuff
you will win eventually though
yeah this game was retarded and i should have died a long time ago
i read the reports but i don't watch the battles unless it is a battle i lose horribly
fortunately you are vanheim so even with almost no research you can make fighting you a living hell
slayer worms killing some shit, yeah, okay
because elf
because it's a shit no vertical wrap and i was in a little tiny corner surrounded by heim
helheim*
makes sense
then helheim died and my neighbors let me get vampire lords
the skeletons going to the throne of bones event will fire for you, conot
haha
the monkies shall become skelemasters
atlanton is this in the ea game
yes
im sure that only took *checks watch* uhh five years?
it's in the 90's right now
have you taken the ea tc throne right by you yet
also how tf has ur not won
i have four vampire lords in sauro game now
thetis went down, but i have liches
so this is disciples?
i am invincible
so yes. i have it
https://imgur.com/5xvh0nc
after i didn't quite win enough to win the game i presumed they were going to roll the map pretty quick
this battle just happened with ur
i don't know how to kill mechanical men efficiently
ur can survive that happening like x10
he only has his forts now, because vampires
has he considered the powerful strat of using his w mages to easily own vampires with cleansing waters
the inevitable result of literally any game without silt running
master smith's don't provide bonus to disciple forts
vamps feel so fucking broken now im not even slightly cautious
ya
i just fly them all over and do stuff
sometimes they die, i dont care
just checked
wraith lords are maybe even worse because they don't even have additional distance cooldown
i need growth scales
just 1 turn global strike
magic is nice too
at least they don't fuckin fly
and cost real gems
they go pretty fkin fast
pan going ai definitely helped, though he wasn't pressing me to begin with.  him going ai definitely let me expand east.
22 map move without any additional gear in their heavy ass normal armour
so i can get quills up asap
everyone in the entire game needs growth
and then skull mentors
except banned nations
t'ien chi should get a national spell to make a mage immortal
probably astral
yeah  but i kill a lot of pop from blood hunting
i could switch to eiru or pangea or somethin
eriu*
why am i the only person who scripts ponymen to do (stormpower)(tstrike)(reinvig)(tstrike)
like do people forget that they have b1
yeah i think people forget that constantly
each one is good for 3 tstrikes
though i usually do 2 and script ghost wolf or orb lightning in the last slot
also why the fuck does blood surge trigger on a magic kill
orb lightning is so insanely dangerous nowadays lol
if i shoot a guy forty spaces away with a lightning why do i get reinvigoration
i don't get to touch his blood
it's far
nah, okay what you like
play
orb lightning fucking shreds shit
it owns hard
very glad illwinter made a good spell better and increased range
the bless grants your units the ability to feel cool as shit when they own somebody
i've only played dom 4 in the past.  disciples game will be new for me
it arcs all over the place but uhh maybe get good and that's np
it's not actually about getting blood from that unit
someone test if blood surge triggers on communions slaves when their master kills a thing
why would i hulk out if i killed a guy far away
maybe a hi 5
because you are a cultivator who cultivates slaughter energy
blood surge is just the best bless period and that's the way it is
yeah it really is
sadly
it should be incarnate
instead of whatever the fuck else is in there that no one cares about
bogarus sacreds should have natural blood surge cmon
like just switch blood surge with blood bond
i imagine that'll happen in a patch sooner or later
illwinter is bad at balance it will never happen unless they make that moddable
i wanna believe <:holy:372894715315748885>
the neter is a giant of divine heritage.  a previous pantokrator gave him power knowledge the moon and stars and the wisdom how to use it.  as guardian of hte celestial bodies he observed what was, what had been, and what would come ot pass.  during the rebellion of the lesser gods, he observed but did not interfere on either side.  for this the pantokrator imprisoned him for eternity.  now with the pantokrator gone his astral prison is weakening and he will return to guide the world as he wills.

the ability to slam down a 2 com point fort+lab+temple halfway through year one for four hundred fifty gold is stupid as fuck
and also it's 450g to turn a forest into a place that makes wizards
forting it just makes the wizards available better and come out twice as fast
and if you get gud you can defeat literally anyone else regardless of bless with level zero magic aoe twenty five entangle/stun/fear no save ofc
nazca is a tier below the others
nazca is pretty fuckin op in ma
more than ma pan imo unless you take a specific counter bless

i'm recording my let's play rn
i'll get to this in a second
i appreciate the daily news *ruffles and folds paper*
<@184675842432040960> yes
i want gems to spend on stupid stuff for fun
and also gold
this map really is something awful
suddenly a huge number of boars appear
at least thats what oyu think is happening, because you and everyone else is permanently blind forever now.
im not igving up
i dont even know what my winning plan is here
but i have 4 thrones. or three thrones. for sure two thrones.
<@153656281448710145> do you need more sprite help, i'll make some sprites for the sea ice if you like
what's the silt mod posted in the mods channel?
it is the mod that makes immortal summons into transformations
it's good
did u put a shout out to the ideas man in the .dm
i didn't
fucked up
hi cryle please dont use racial slurs in a way that gets people to make me look at a individual game channel
too bad you can't have custom spells linked to pretender chasis.
so you think johan and kristoffer have a ideas man - thing doer relationship
you kind of can silly things
that's what the word on the street had been back in the day.
they both do a bit of everything, but jk is definitely more of the programmer and ko is more of a sprite maker and lore builder
that one of them made up nations, and the other coded in new abilities for them
my phone auto coreected spillything to silly thing
like ko can make a vanilla nation as well as any of us, but custom dom-effects would be jk
i am a silly thing. i'm here on discord instead of out buying a gift for my special lady
speaking of the word on the street, do not splash information about beta versions you hear on here on the dom3mods forum ty please
hokay will not do that in the future, sorry

there u go spillything
can anyone less stupid than me derive the likely bitmask for 1 crown please using the information in the mod manual
apparently your winning plan is to attack innocent good boy yomi
for shame
new turns, in mekone
<@114740794476331015> you ready to agree to stop fucking with tnn or shall i keep pillaging your awful uw tiles
on an unrelated note, i have enormous cauldrons of broth, who wants some :toot:
pan going ai basically created a giant landrush which meant no one wanted to fuck with icy asshole land
can flyers fly uw
sometimes
full amphibious ones do
like asia dragon
and teleporter
idk what elese
i do
but for example if they're given uw capability by a magic item that doesn't give them amphibious they can't
?
does marverni not get decent n mages
anyway, name your price
do you want e gems
<@282646158218756116> you'll be glad to know your corpse in stupidrobot still has a pulse
what uw capability item is there that doesn't make them amphib
my income of e is pretty okay rn tbh
things i would not say no to: f or a gems, or price of cauldron + 5 in n gems
alternatively gold, if we can figure out a price that seems fair
this is too rich for marverni, we can barely afford to feed our families in this eternal hellwinter
isn't that hellwinter self inflicted from your awful scales
yes
why would you ever build temples and not just let the tnn scales in
more temples = more dom, more dom = moar boars
if you make it that far
marverni's scales, for reference

are you still selling that warf hammer cryle
protip: never take luck
say that to my misfortune 3 jomon that got fucked out of the game in like, 3 turns
well i mean it means the throne of autumn had no downside for him
i am familiar with the jomon saga
mukip u got fier gems
no, sadly
deaf gems?
nope
a lotof gold?
lmao
look at his scales
he's lucky if he has any gold
do you have a single goddamn thing that you can use to trade, tnn
yes
a shit ton of gems and a fairly reasonable amount of gold
and cauldrons of broth
who cares about soup
oh my god all he does is make soup all game
people who enjoy not starving in wastes
so gem, but none of the good gems, and gold, but not the 500g i would ask for the hammer
"none of the good gems"
i have e and some amount of fwa
give me your fire gems
name your price, dwarf hammer maker
20 fire gems
wait no 25
wait no 20
yeah 20
for everyone else its 25. for conot, my friend, elf, it is 20.
hmmmmmm
okay sure
wait
1 of your finest dwarf hammers please
are you going to use this for soup
how would i make soup with a hammer
that sounds silly
i dont know
elf magic
ok deal
you are tnn right
y
and you are uh
!details
machaka
oh bot ded

rip
ooh ahh machaka
cool, sending gems to machachachaka
i also have spooky masks if anyone wants, 20 gems each
there are lots of spooky masks
true amphib not poor
unless they fucked with it poor amphib does not fly uw
the most powerful water unit is still the water elemental and the most powerful water ranged is the storm demon same as dom4 tho
shout out to agartha, who lost a battle to ai abysia because, i dont even know how or why.
i think an annointed got surrounded by magma kids, protecting it from the enemies that could actually kill it, and pinning it in place so it couldnt retreat, until eventually agartha routed
pills of water breathing don't give amphib to the units being transported by it i don't think?
all of the uw items like that give poor amphib to units
ah
storm demons aren't water though
they're blood
that require water
wait
no that's frost demons
you've confused me, monkee
you're forgetting the part where i also lost a shitload of guys
and yes, the age old solution of throwing more magma children at it doesn't apply when fighting abysia.  who knew, right?
you crushed 90% of his army immediately
its true
he meant units that are curently in the uw
yeah what he means is that water elementals are the best at fighting underwater, and storm demons are the best at ranged combat underwater

ok
ulm+pyth?
yeah make sure you have some kind of synergy with your nations
also i'd like to order all the teams 'pretender + disciple' so include that too when you post your team
i'm the pretender
i have no idea if we synergize outside of me dumping early quills on my friend
divine is obv the disc
once i find air gems
the synergize is usually something like similar temps/bless benefiets
benefits
also not having scales for high res nations with a low res nation and visa versa
i'm down if you are prey, we'll knock our heads together and stratagize
to the mod inspector
protip: nations that get a bless bonus or a good dominion effect are good for pretenders
also protip: dont pick a domkill nation as your pretender
what does legions of steel do to some who's naked
yeah unless i'm totally misremembering who pythium is that aint a problem for us
nothing
also:ma ermor is offlimits and i'm running a pan nerf mod
oh, is that posted in <#401498099622608911> ?
or do you not need to have mods installed client side for multiplayer games? i'm pretty new to multi
nah when you join the game it'll download
good to know
that's convenient
what are the pan nerfs?
it gives them the pride of being in a legion

maybe hes dead

i'm playing agartha,  would like to team with someone who wants a good bless.

nah, he submitted for this turn, but stalled on the prior one
[10:40 pm] prey: or do you not need to have mods installed client side for multiplayer games? i'm pretty new to multi
most mods will download and save when you connect
some mods will partially download and then crash your client repeatedly 30 turns in
ohno lol
because the game looks at, like, 1000 files
and then says "nobody could ever want more than 1000 files" and assumes the download is good
i think they fixed this in dom5 by increasing the number
seems like a weird workaround ü§î
literally one cave province on the map
my cave requirement was probably what was fucking up the map starting
<@120675876043096066> why
!details

master assassin huh
"so why does people like <@96715337440952320> not like disciple games etc" <@68614451045076992>  i personally don't like disciple games because they don't add very much to the game mechanically (and in some ways are just annoying - no wait command in allied lands for example), and they're more of a headache in terms of co-ordination and diplomacy. but that's just me!
which pan nerfs mod are you running <@68614451045076992>
i helped some guy out with one, i think you're probably using that one which i don't think does anything about their hp and might not even change their leadership, but does make wcs 80 gold
in my case i would be worried about dragging down my team mate in a gametype that would explicitly punish dead weight
i don't care if i get my ass killed like i did in <#405481368353505291> because its just me
but if its disciples then my team mate gets fucked by losing their team-mate
remember when nuclearmonkee made a map for a disciple game and asked me to hand place the starts and i accidentally placed one start so poorly hatwer quit dominions forever
thats not actually what happened but it is how i choose to remember it.
disciples can eat butt shit.
hm
idk what's good abt pan that needs to be nerfed
here is a small list that will neglect some things prob:

- seduction w/very likely swarm kills even on most failures on a useful research mage + leader
- recuperation and very large hp pools means you do not attrition very hard
- troops are heavily discounted and good
- all your research mages are also competent commanders
- you can get forts with nature gems as well as buying them (and can cast mother oak with a thistle mace on commanders from any fort)
- you get 25 gold flying scouts + troops from every single forest
- you get discounted infrastructure in forests
- pans are extremely good mages as well as good commanders and freespawners
- research path is a charge down alteration to get you everything you need early including gem -> fort conversion (research 0 for ea pan)
- very good god selection + useful sacred troops as well as sacred commanders, which unlike monkeys who just pay more for it with little benefit all have holy paths as well as troop leadership and lots of hp
- good national battlemagic as well as general earth/nature/some water + whatever you steal
- stealth on everything (which improves their already excellent map mobility due to forest survival on everything)
- nature + holy commanders everywhere mean you can fight quite well even in 0 pop lands vs undead
dang
its ok with teams of 2 i think.
<@96715337440952320> https://youtu.be/ojwadgiaz7i

if a fort has 3 com points
should i be queuing up multiple mages per turn in that fort
so i get one and a half dudes per turn
have i only been recruiting 66% of the reborns i could be recruiting
yes

well fuck
trolled by dom5
get this though:
instead of wasting gold on mages you could have 3 scouts per fort per turn.
3 cum points.

what magic do i cast to kill a big bull
i think its immune to skeletons probably
it has 20 prot and regens 50 hp a turn
and negative encumbrance
don't tell him
it's a trap
disintegrate
soul slay
horror mark
what paths do you have
skeletons
pig make
all of the mr die spells basically
turn to frog
frozen heart
panic, terror
mind hunt
send horror
panic + terror will do nothing
yes it will
if you do it before you berserk him
for one thing they cap at -5 scare
so it's rolling vs 25
does it really
yes
that's dumb
i agree, it is only useful vs garbage now
centaurs or whatever dgaf
panic + terror will do nothing: the complete guide to being a millennial.
im ea ermor and i have a rainbow pretender
but its early game
so i have like evo5 ench5
i can horror mark him to fuck maybe
but he will just trample over skeletons and stay at full hp with 0 fatigue until my mages get tired
my research is good so i can maybe hit a rp target before he reaches my cap

i could defeat your bull by... paying you to go away
how do you mod spells to transform yourself, is that documented anywhere
the power of capitalism
i am just sort of opportunistically taking border shit in my candles and dont plan to rush your cap anyway
people told me i had cool foriegn recruit shit in swamps and you had a swamp on my border while you were being killed by giants
and lo, i do!
that swamp was for lizard shamans and flamens
it was
now it is for enkidu bone tribe cosplay
and probably also shamens
i can also use some astral access after all
just wait until i get 10 bane fire casters
i will wait
let me know when ok
anyway i am just taking your lands for safekeeping for your own good
9000 years in browser paint program
once you easily defeat the :squints at scout report: fire shield blood vengeance giants i will return them
anyway please do not kill my bull or else i will have to revive him in like 2-3 turns with 0 consequences because i am ur
oh yeah ur doesn't lose paths on pretender death
do you still have the %chance to gain a point of death?
<@317410996169736204> probably look at silt mod to see how transform modding works
i don't know
probably prey, there's also a tiny chance for blood
you have to already have blood and death tho
also my research mage-priests count for more
when reviving!
so there you go
so no suiciding my bull over and over to break into blood and death?
perpetually warp your bull into the ocean until blood 9 ü§î
solid plan
solid ea ur plan
<@282646158218756116> good idea jsoh.
the one time i let my yomi pg die
he *lost* a level of death on rez
fucked up
it's like 10/1% for death /blood probably
i suggested that they make ur pg come back with 0 experience or afflictions and with all empower and curse and horror marks removed but they didn't go for it
so there's actually some downside to this really strong ability
still laughing at the "and not at all any kind of second thing" punchline, one day later.
what happens if i raid a province someone else is sieging
ok guys steam forums accidentally found the most powerful thing in the game
wishing for a doom horror makes it eat the throne
lmao
that fucking owns
does that work before cataclysm
why wouldn't it
i mean give it a shot, i haven't tested it myself
the throne eating stuff is just a unit tag you can apply to anything
so even send horror theoretically
correct
with good rolls
correct
blood is strong
and 0 pd
if it beats pd i'm guessing it'll eat a throne in the part of the turn it exists
on the grounds that this is how they work if they beat pd on a forted throne in cataclysm
it only exists for the magic battle phase
since they are tagged to fuck off after one turn innit?
err one battle
in any case
wishing for doom horror eating a throne is so ftw
yeah
i guess if you get a good roll on the wish and they dont quit fast enough you could kill one or two thrones
for a hundred gems
ya
worth tbh
whats up with fucking caelum in theorodos game having a enchantment discount site with a fort and no lab
maybe it froze in the cold
or they deleted the lab to infuriate an attacker
they been ai
holy moley
i really doubt they deleted it before going ai but maybe
and the ai just didn't put a lab there over tge last year
what do i do with 250 fire gems
what faction are you
therodow
gimme a sec to check if the right answer isn't "wait until 5.15 when you get a huge new spell"
i guess i can make skull of fire to go with ring of wizards, forge a fire hat and uhh
have f5
maybe 6 depending on random
make a skull of fire and use it to obtain 4000 gold
im already forging 3 lanterns a turn
what happens to the victory count when a horror eats a throne?
it goes down by the amount of points the throne was worth
i might run out of research before cataclysm
is it that j brereton i thought it went down proportionally
idk it was that way in like 4.97
sec
i will see
i will see

im bringing my fuckin switch gunna play mario kart to try to stay awake
im glad i work for several hours a day on a computer, instead of for days at a time in a toxic gas factory
will you be standing or sitting around
fully horizontal and loving it
i actually prefer working at the limb removal factory over the office
on exciting days my limbs might get removed by a robot
ill keep you posted.
i really really like doing things with my hands
i would go insane at a computer toucher position
at the limb removal factory the people aren't uptight office drones and you do real work until it's done. when it's done no one even pretends to be working we just fuck around until their shift ends
thats how work should be
agree actual office work sucks like hell
i am soon to do some office work and i hate it but bills
before boss told me that i had to go back to sleep so i could work tonight i was sitting at my counter eating a cookie that someone else paid for
i prefer working from home
listening to music
too bad no one will let me üò¢

and yeah my brain does the "good job idiot you did a thing that actually works and something tangible comes out the other end!

i have a desk that adjusts so i can stand or sit
everyone whos done this  plant before says theres lots of cleaning
lots of masks to clean
but i havent seen it yet
i don't think it would boing
manual work owns
it makes you crazy if it's *repetitive*

repititive stress injuries even have their own name

<@282646158218756116> please don't spoil my nazi traps tyvm
it's part of why i like modding dominions, because it is very very easy to make a thing and have it do something inside that framework
dominions is the second best game i've ever modded for
yeah when the robot machine works again and returns to it's duty of occasionally amputating fingats it's very good
the first best being warcraft 3
i like doing the same thing over and over and over again and iteratively improving
thats why the only jokes i ever write use the ancient forms .
i lose my god damn mind doing repeat tasks
the only repeat task i can stand is
data entry
b/c its kinda zen
ughhh
like if i have a job that involves doing x more than maybe 10 times i will spend a couple hours making the computer do it for me
even if i could have done it in less
take apart regulator
clean
insepct
repair if req
rebuild regulator
love it.
ya i always go somewhat broke brained repeating things and as soon as p much any opportunity to not repeat that thing again appears i take it
dont worry because ai will obsolete all manual labour within 20 years
that is not true
nah it won't boing
if i have anything to say about it
it will obsolete repetitive manual labor, and already pretty much has if people feel like buying the robot
the only way a robot obsoletes my job is if they build a robot that can clean oil for cheaper than a man can
and a man will do it preetttty fucking cheap
for one thing builders have the get up and go to kick the shit out of a robot so expect building to stay manual for a long time
theres no way to make a robot that actually does my job so i would have to be obsoleted by not having to have safety for the guys doing the actual work
servicing machines is not something that is easy to automate because a human will do more than just clean the machine
the human will notice if the machine is breaking or fucking up
robots are even obseleting the retard masturbator job
yeah thats what i mean
a robot wouldnt do my actual job just the jobs that rely on my job to be completed
there will always be human slaves for the robots
my boss is working on robots that dispose nuclear waste
and even those are fucking way hard for a robot to do
!details

or maybe not always but at least for the next 20 years
let me know when you have a robot that can wade into 14 feet of highly corrosive sludge and blast chemicals at it for 24 hours a day
robots can do almost anything manual the question is if it costs less or more than the equivilent human labor
and not blow up or break down
more than a human being would
robots + humans break down in different ways and that's a whole other kettle of fish
man call lesser horror failed hard
maybe i shouldnt have cast hellpower
trying to keep the fucking robot clean and functional would almost certainly be more expensive than paying 2 crackheads to do it
oh is that where all the horrors came from
i was wondering
but you gotta make sure the crackheads die off site instead of on site
are you a
crackhead jsoh
no
he has 3 people for that
im the guy who keeps the crackheads from dying until they hit the gate
lol
labor practice, everybody
honestly they are mostly meth or alcoholics
yeah one of the operators i work with at the largest bio mass power plant in oregon is a raging alcoholic
like if he has to work extra and cant make it to the bar when his shift ends he starts shaking and stuff
turns out people who willingly wade into 10 feet of toxic corrosive sludge sometimes have social problems
yeah
can a devourer of souls
devour horror souls
yes
yep
bc <@178868273935417344> horror marked my god but i think its fine
ok
he can devour any souls
yeah devourer doesn't give a single fuck
he's the devourer of souls!
i didnt know if horrors had souls.
you know some of the horrors have the same attack as devourer of souls right
theirs are mr negate though arent they
sos his innit
no
its the same attack
devourer is just lol u die

the devourer is why i did not attack boing
well, that and the land immediately between us is trash
so i'd have to already be winning before i saw any gains at all
!details geneva

i assassinated a bunch of birb mages and recovered a quill
i didnt think devourer would dissuade you that much
he kills one unit per turn forever
well the way to defeat a devourer is skelespam
but your nation is better at that than his
what are the geneva rules
and with a handful of trash decoys he will delete all of my units
and also you have stompers
which are strong vs skelespam
you are a conundrum
stompers don't matter since my dumb giants are size four
theym atter since they kill bugs and skeletons
the devourer beats a rush though
tomb chariots seem to actually have a good attack
against large dudes
!unit tomb chariot
<@148098869782118401>: https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/?page=unit&unitq=tomb%20chariot&showmodcmds=1&showmoddinginfo=1&showids=1
they have 5 hp or whatever
they dont fight gamhirds and win
i would only need the size 4 to wall the wizards would delete the chariots
so they get overkilled by powerful giants
they are very easy to delete
also that
boing can i rely on you to not touch the poo and leave me alone in my tower of books
like you can just spam star fires into them and they all die chariots are nbd if you have big
patala is ai just take patalas shit
we already did
i see their flag
or is there more on the other side he hasn't taken yet
take the rest of absums shit i dont want it
after this turn patala will have zero things by us
citadels take forever to siege
do you hear that absum
ive diplomanced you into freedom!
i already have citadels to siege im not attacking absums
they do indeed take fucking forever
can someone fuckin trade me 10 death gems so i dont have to alchemize
i learned about 3 com point forts today.
ive found 0 death gems
boing dont you have a 3 com point cap
does ctis not have 3 commnd points
sorry all death gems go toward chariot production
you are so fucking bad
my cap had 3 command points but i was making one empoisoner a turn
now all my forts have 3 command points.
lmao
i lost a army to indies on turn 27 or whatever it is im eternally shamed
16 fuckin heavy cav wtf
i expertly scouted that battle
it was good
boing did you realize you can queue two empoisoners yet
nuclear monkey, absum, i need 10 d or a skull staff
i have done that now
and have 2,1,2,1 etc
ok good
now im recruiting 1.5 reborns a turn from every fort which is even better
did they break mason last patch because i noticed the game is allowing me to upgrade my stuff to citadels
i hope thats how it works anyway
utgard starts with a 2 com point cap
but i noticed i had the option to upgrade it and am doing so
plz no exploiterino
also can u at least say no to me about trading for some d
it is quite possible monkee that they have a shitty startfort
they do have a shitty start fort
but was i allowed to upgrade it all along
i just want to make a labia queen...
luckily that is now moddable
because it's like 450 for a cap com point
that's a good deal
idk how many d i have jsoh
i think it's some
my double gold mine is a castle now or hwatever the highest level agartha can build and is 300 golds
jbrereton please mod silt to make a specific spell so skratti vampires are still skratti
so i can have a flying invulnerable immortal wolf man
if you make the sprites monkee i will make a seperate release of things with their own vamp sprite
using the power of #onlymnr
what does a vampire skratti look like
absum fuclker abusm
i see u
it looks like a skratti doing count drac cosplay
so he sparkles?
and has a cape
with a dress shirt and a popped collar + cape
this is incidentally exactly how all vcs look
if u make vampire skratti shapeshift into vampire werewoofs and vampire large dogs thast probably insanely overpowered
and maybe in werewolf form they have a bat instead of wolf head
they need to give the fucking mod tagggggg so we can make vampire spell just impart fly immortal invuln25 undead cr15 pr15
and i guess fire vuln five
and afraid of water
oh wait it goes palisade fortress castle citadel
but i can still make citadels
monkee people would be bewildered if it did not visually look like a vampire
fuck those people
worm and lich changing ur body makes sense but vampire not so muhc
i just want to transform immensely powerful units into vampires and shit
lich should just get a lich thats the correct size
i understand + relate monkee but otoh without amusing sprites, whats the point
all casters with significant death and blood paths should get custom vampire sprites
ms paint red blood drops around mouth
this needs to be a project
to at least make special sprites for all of the common db wizards
grammas, skratti need to be vamps
lumpy gramma with a luxurious cape
all priest vampires need to be carrying a big ass crucifix
or star of david for gath etc
why would a priest vampire carry a crucifix
i dont know sounds suspiciously anime
for liches it's easy at least
just big lich
lizard lich. i already made that btw
i made a ghul lich sprite and it was surprisingly difficult
does life after death still make agarthas twice as strong
saurolichcraft is in the la predator lizard mod
nice
i should update that and make a game with it
if i send a telkhine with a staff of storms to turn 1 acid rain will that wipe a bird army
i guess lots of those stormy fly
.markov lizard people
hmm.
you will need some guards on the telkhine
.markov
weird it works on test server
look at dat sexy beast
i could make it smaller for a regular lizard
nb: sprites must be at least slightly more high effort than this
uhh im pretty sure that's perfect
uhh im pretty sure that's perfect
is that a t shirt
no. it's a poofy fancy vampire shirt
no. it's a poofy fancy vampire shirt
with a popped collar and a red cape
with a popped collar and a red cape
very vampire
very vampire

this just landed on the fort hes standing in
this just landed on the fort hes standing in
time to shademail and fuck off
im pretty sure i kill it actually
lmo
the fuckin
annunaki is  holding a staff of storms already
what
http://puu.sh/zopsd/25c29ed17b.jpg
this kills the birds i believe
is that a telkhine who makes it puke
ya
im pretty sure the acid rain will get the job done tho
a lot faster than the fart
ive got another telkhine in the fort but this guys breaking siege
ok i think that kills the birds unless they fire largest and have a really good shoot bless
they have death bless i think
the guys ai
oh right rip birds
reanimators
is his bless
the absolute madman
the only things that are storm immune are the archers who are going to not immediately rush my guys and slay them with their magic weapons
so i get to defeat them all iwth acid rain and hopefully not lose my guy
but he has 90 hp and should be regenning
gonna lol if 6 fravashi instantly blow those commanders to pieces
theres only 1 commander whos allowed a fravashi
unless more guys show up idk
unless they are specifically targetted with #guardspiritbonus -99999 or what have you i think they're all valid
yeah none of them are priests
its only priests allowed to make those guys
are u sure
ive never seen a not sacred make one
i guess you'll find out b/c a telkhine is quite spooky
but i could be wrong idk i dont play inferior birdmans
im pretty sure a fravashi or 4 wont kill my telkhine
of that list i guess only the mairya is a sacred but i think (not 100% sure) that all ea caelums get a shot at a guardian spirit
i have to wake up in six hours
good luck at the puke pits of carcares
im going to make a quiche bye for now
i mean i have the paths and they all unlock at conj8
wow queens did work
master smith (2)
i was nort expecting this
server down?
huh, what has that?
<@282646158218756116> be careful to not hp route yourself
acid storm is going to kill all of your goast
hmm
maybe less ghost
your boss man should be at least twenty six percent of all hp
does his shapeshifted hp count
it looks at starting hp
before any summons, retinues, etc
he will have regen right
so maybe 30% of total hp
to allow for a particularly brutal acid storm tick
that wouos only allow for like 4 ghosrs with fluffers
do you have bottles of living water
they act as bonus
do blood slaves count for that hp
no
ok maybe take 30 blood slaves if you can
blood slaves and waters and stuff pop up as retinues
to act as meat screen
they will all melt to death in a couple rounds
maybe if you wooden/marble them
that's okay
i have bottles of water
the point is to not get killed instantly by iceclad
mighty marble blood slaves
i can wood them
[telkhine voice] in absolute awe at the size of this 'clad
a thick layer of slaves and some ghosts with bottles will do it
you can stack bottles on more commanders if you need to with a powerful script of retreat
each can hold two. it's allowed
if you were an insanely good nation you could also wear the buffalo hat
the *mega* smith
i think guard commanders will retreat with them now
the water eles from bottles dont guard
they will do water ele things
maybe include a swarm caster or two
the bugs don't have to live long and acid storm is only 50% of battlefield per tick
piles of garbage strategem really is the best strat i think
overall
*weeps and throws his flask into the air after reading jerek's message*
they keep changing retinue orders i think; they're back to attack now after the guard intermezzo
yeah they unfucked it thank god
the best phase was when retinues guarded and also appeared on castle walls
love to have my water elementals guarding the wall along with my blood slaves
but monkee it owned that water bottles in cold provinces completely terminated your own communion
yeah and doesn't fatigue damage interrupt
so the layers of cold would just continually cancel spells
until you passed out and died
ya lol
not sure about fatigue damage interrupt but constantly stacking snownage was real
varfur flames is actualy really strong now did anyone notice that
because units love to fuck around in the gate house area
running back and forth because the wall archers jangle keys at them
has anyone ever used the put lions in front of your fort spell ever
no
it's bad
it got cut off, expect part 2 this turn
it makes order
so u csn have more rec points, or not a civil war
does it make it fast enough to matter
maybe? idk
or is it like all of the other spells not named illwinter in that it is almost entirely cancelled by your dominion
isn't it like level 8
hany many geoms does it require
too many
it's ten +  n
with n being desired duration i think
it seems ass
i have sixty nine unread emails. i am terminating the connection with the mail server
nice

probably then
ice elementals are better than water elementals right
they have cold aura
which beats.. uhh.. no cold aura
they also trample instead of having attacks
and have protection
instead of no protection
so: probably
it occasionally might depend, based on what you're fighting

my biggest dom5 weakness is that i lack the resolve to follow through on murdering someone unless they start shit
i'm like the biggest isolationist
wheres my one province strat for dom
your biggest weakness is anime.
no one wants to diplomance with an anime.
in the world where weakness means strength, sure
also you literally diplomanced with me like 2 turns ago in <#407478578054168577>
and its a double example because you're anime in that game
but i want spells
i just said "hey dont attack me" and you didnt
proving your anime based weakness
how do i find the ip?

are there even 60 thrones in the throne list?
oh, misread
now i'm kind of disappointed tbh
<@68614451045076992> like i can do the teams for you but someone said the new version of dom5 added a teams ui to the start

yes
neat
it's like when you're the game server except you can just set your own team
you don't have to let the host do it
yeah
if it works like that then this is good
yeah i've never used anything but llamaserver and direct connect
<@168228493174374400> just connect to the server

<@173517171496845312> connect to snek.earth:30085
well now you don't have to
indeed
the mod is dont allow pans in you game

i'm doion something wrong
doin
the 300085 doesnt go in the first box
:in an extremely pan voice: that seems extreme
it goes in the one after
h lol
oh
and no colon
yes
okay thanks
got it working
give me a second and i'll write you one up
oh didn't know we had the immortality mod
probably should change up my god who was supposed to be making vampires eventually
yeah
rip
what does that mod do
instead of making a vamp, you become a vamp
uploaded
mod idea to balance pan: every turn every province owned by a pan gets an event that causes a heron to attack, increasing unrest and killing population
<@282646158218756116> does the vamp mod basically make the vamp spell useless
or just different uses
dont ping me in this garbage channel
see now i'm kinda tempted to run an azi just so i can make it an immortal
also its not my mod
you talk abt vamps alot so i forget
if you have good casters you want to be immortal seems pretty good
it makes it so you have vampires with different paths than default vampires
and also makes it so you have very many less vampires
etc
if you are trying to break into death with them it kinda messes with you
i guess it's good if you have a tiny baby wizard pretender or an immobile pretender
think of it as uber twice born
or a mage with good combat paths but not a good combat body
<@!148098869782118401>  ill give u 600 gold for that province we bumped in and 12 turn nap
wow the perfect pan mod
my idea is probably better than whatever that is
which is probably :set era 0
no it is in fact an attempt
rather than take nations entirely out of the game mod
what it do?
do you read mod-ese?
<@282646158218756116> be advised that you are disciple games work with the built-in tools johan has graced you with
im not in this game and i will not play a disciple game but thna kyou for that.
hmm it turns out it needs a tweak as i didn't realise la pan got cheap temples everywhere thus making their description + 400 gold temples in forests a bit weird, sec
i also saw that already the first time you said it i think
but in general it's basically a 30%ish hp nerf, leadership nerf, infrastructure cost nerf, and rp nerf to pan plus moving castle make spells to constr
having a heron come and mess up their pots and pans every turn is more thematic.
also black harpies are more expensive and manakins are less completely shit worthless for ma aspho because they were a tragedy
did manikans get nerfed or soemthing
they are really strong? multiple magic weapon attacks that do sleep
they are not so strong in practice
its impossible to know
the game itself is stale
they are not strong enough to make up for losing black centaurs after a year but they are strong

this fucking shit is so fucking useless
if the oracle had any armour and a charcoal shield he'd have won that solo
fat lazy fucker
fine
when he wakes up he can make himself some armour
i didn't do anything, they just work through the miracles of illwinter
here we go updated version which fixes the la pangaea temple cost issue
kremath are you using the updated siltmod or the old one

how is the silt mod in practice?
looks intriguing
is there a place i can see the changes in the we like options mod?

samog i feel like yes but only for making fun sprites of vamps but it's a witch king from sauromatia or similar
bot fucking dead
i am confused.  when i need to do something,  let me know what to do.
does this mod really buff air elementals?
can you link me the .dm file?
just drag it onto here and it'll work

it does appear to buff air elementals yes

okay,  i'm working out how this works.  only used llama and direct connect so far.   is this a pbem  system or direct direct?
that is not a doable thing kremath, well, hope htat helps
sign up to my game there's 3 spots left
oh my god
connect to network game
put in snek.earth
gotcha
then the port 30085

thought snek.earth was a meme,  but it is also the real url
blanced_teams broke the bot lol
click your nation to upload god and set yourself to the correct team disc/pretender status
turns out it can't handle disciple games
yep!
another big strike against them
i'm fixing it now
how did it break it
okay,  direct connect is ez, especially when it actually has a registered url.
did you just import a half dozen people from someplace else to fill your game kremath lmao
it caused an overflow in the atrociousness array
i think anyway
```
impl submissionstatus {
    pub fn from_int(x: u8) -> self {
        match x {
            0 => submissionstatus::notsubmitted,
            1 => submissionstatus::partiallysubmitted,
            2 => submissionstatus::submitted,
            _ => panic!("unrecognised submission_status {}", x),
        }
    }
}
```
that error failed
im going to play recklessly and with the diplomatic ability of trump
from official discord jsoh
because i refuse to make it to the late game in a disciple game
sorry, "official" discord
you are in the very official discord server please be polite
my current theory is that disciple games has some submission status that isn't 0, 1, or 2
maybe it's during the team picking section of the pregame bit
else submissionstatus::fuckedup
yeah i think it reuses the field for team number
because <:illwinter:372894192894214176>
oh no
fine, putting an unknown in there i guess
well i slept for like two hours
grats
and i leave for work in ten minutes
i ate a bunch of free food and i think that was not the play because its making me sleepy
free food fucking owns you did the right thing
well
consume caffeine
all of my food is free until june or something lmao
i jumped into an endless pit of dominions discord servers and somehow ended up here.
yeah theres a vending machine across the street from my trailer that takes bank cards with pepsi in it
this is the one at the bottom of the mountain of garbage. welcome
so i will be fine
my heart maybe not
straight to the bottom i'm so lucky
this is somewhere between my first and third mp game of dominions, depending on how quickly it starts.   so be gentle.
if we are neighbors i will provide teachable moments
that is all i will commit to

<@68614451045076992>: error: could not find the game with alias chat

disciples games are awful so just try to enjoy yourself and don't be afraid to go ai if you aren't having fun
"don't be afraid to go ai"
<@282646158218756116> yes, i purroused the other dominions discords
i expect terrible things from unclustered starts,  but at least all my units can fly.
oh are the starts not clustered lmao
ps we're playing with a mod that gives asphodel masive buffs, and theyre generally a good play in disciple games, so take them out asap
are we playing with a mod to buff asphodel
yes
i thought it was just silt
or something
there are 2 mods
one to buff you.
apprently they are running a half cut jbbm thing called "we love options" or something
probalby do not run asphodel buff mod because i buffed myself by playing under someone with no domkill
it buffs you in terms of manikins + their spawn rate after year 1, it has quite severe nerfs to your normal stuff
i have no manikin
so it is a nerf mod then
good luck
congratulations: you do have manikin due to the mod
so i get manikin and no popkill
lmao
what?
ffs
also a disciple asph still has manikin
probably turn that off
i tested it
that's stupid
the pretender dom doesn't have manikin
tho
actually monkee reading the scripting
is that without the mod
there apparently are differences now between pretender and disciple dom in terms of freespawn nations and stuff without the mod
unless you have 14000 pop (or the req_maxpop command is broken) or below you will not get them
without the mod there are no mannies
because when we were messing with it, asphodel has no popkill and freespawn
it was just pan but with death magic and no seduce
so to reiterate: do not bvc monkee or he will actually get more units
bvc is broke
so
i will bvc myself
who cares
the popkill works
bvc reduces pop kremath
who cares
lmao
i want my passive aggressive thug diseaser please
it's fixed next patch
finally
but seriously please do not put in a mod that horribly breaks everything and gives me freespawn but no popkill
i assume the mod was not designed for use in disicples
ok
i dont think air elementals need mirror image either...
hey <@173950598138298368> can you take 'we like options' off of this game
air elementals are fairly shit in dom 5 dont call
?
i disagree
i already started pretender upload
oh no

what do you have on offer
air nature and a tiny bit of earth
wait arent the guy who said everyone should team up on cryle
i will trade pearls
give me three death gems per pearl
i appreciate your willingness to trade monkey, but decline your offer
uhh i guess i like... .earth? the most? maybe? out of htose
ok, 3d per 2s
that's better than you can alchemise by half a pearl!!
also i have negative death gems, i owe someone
yes. me
that is untrue
i have it here on this very official looking document
your document may look official, but is clearly not notarized
<@184675842432040960> i have all of 2 earth gems
this needs to autoplay in here https://soundcloud.com/boksi-1/elephants-trampling-blood-slaves-forever
which i would happily trade for pearls
alchemize them into fire gems
and ill trade 1:1
i also have a magical ~enchanted shield~ which i would be willing to part with
powerful
i would try to give it to my uttervast but it wouldn't work
i just tried giving it to a knight commander for a modest upgrade and he opted to give up using his broad sword for some reason
maybe because his weapon order is lance/sword/hoof/horn
and assigning a shield removes additonal weapons after the first that aren't innate?
more people should join geneva imo
so i can feed my turn addiction
uh, did you put it in his first or second hand

<@214468489698607105>  gg
tfw you accidentally join donair-cam-voice and discord crashes
real relatable feel
so uh. is curse of stones supposed to go away when the mage falls asleep/
because that's what happened. he cast curse of stones and it immediately went away.
he passed his stones
curse of stones is like
a mr check every turn or something
its not a battlefield enchant
did the mage die
also i thought curse of stones just happened once
and units were either stonecursed or not
from then on
my face when somebody else tries to trade with criyle
yeah
mr chexk to be cursed
then mr check to stop being
i think
maybe not
is a garbage spell
i don't think that second one, i think it lasts to the end of the battle
but is maybe mr negates easily
either way
sucks ass
jbre said it slows now, in addition to being  an (i think open ended) extra d6 of fatigue a turn
so it might not be worthless in all scenarios
does he not trade or something?
it's no rigor morris tho
no he just literally never offers a good deal
or anything approaching one
i saw the battlefield enchantment go up and everything turn red
it's
not
a battlefield enchant
is a spell that hits entire field
the pentagram goes up for a sec
but looking at the dudes now, it makes sense
<@233383745779007499> <@117041423492186112> <@124333039735013376> <@114740794476331015>
‚¨Ü
did they add a way to edit arenas yet
got it just now
who did you cast it into, and did it have the desired effect?
living pillars
and no
oh, that's fine then
<@159883716758470656> <@!169456837236621312> waiting on the two of you
oh, on it
it never has yhe desired effect
is only good vs ulms
submitted, all on the monkey
living pillar have mr 8
and a 10 enc
they should be the perfect target
seems good yeah
did it affect any of them noticeably
a few went from 9 enc to 12
(i mean other than the part where, if the living pillars are going to be defeated by encumbrance, you have won before the battle starts)
it should also slow them and i think add a d6 of fatigue, meaning they should get tired even faster than 12 says they should
but yeah like jsoh said
if past indications are relevant at present, he is dealing with children and will take turn shortly assuming he didn't fall asleep like a weakling
i mean, what kind of jackass wears a dense rock as armor
what could they possibly expect
anyone wanna buy a cyclops hammer
idk what to do with the dang thing
isn't that the forge thing
it gives master smith
i'd be interested in borrowing it at least
could bang out a winged helm/bag o winds
get me pictures of firegems!
it's good againts ulms because ulms can do literally anything while they are awake
but also have low mr and high encumbrance
<@110124675580862464> i'll trade this hammer for the ring of sorcery i know you have
pillars exist to get hit
i am interested in a cyclops hammer
how should i kill them with uw magic
would you let me borrow it jerek?
yeah, sure
who are you
that fucking cyclops nukes my army with shadowblast
and completely whiffs it pointblank to your elephants
ghosts
i have rp now though
kindof
i can melt his boner and make water elementals
it used all its shadowblasts on u
also, i can put my destruction mages within 25 range
so they actually cast it
if you can buff water elementals with prot they mulch them probably
is there a app for android that can so gapless playback of music and has shuffle album also
this thing i been using is fucking up over bluetooth rn
my strategy for playing therodos is to ban water nations in the game
this guy let me get lanterns and quills for a few years
so i think i can do it
can't google music shuffle albums? just need to turn off online features so it doesn't try to sell you shit
the guy should just send his magic spear guys ti slay you
if there's something better i'd also like to know
google play music doesbt do gapless playback or shuffle album
i dont remember which
but it doesn't do obe of them
im using dead beef 2 rn
although to be fair i'm a square who generally listens to albums
without shuffle
or podcasts
so i guess i don't *need* anything better
i listen to albums but dont generally pick them
the whole reason i use this thing is its supposed to do gapless playback but its got gaps jerry!
sorry, i feel like i missed stuff
i've had a busy day
how do i connect?

<@110124675580862464> would you trade me the sorcery ring? i might be able to swing money which i'm guessing you need

so do i need to disable the mod to play sp / other mp and enable it to play this?
other mp will automaticly load/unload mods
you will want to check your mod settings before starting new sp games though, probably
what came

pankor
from an indy
stupid game
ill pay one more gold than him
wait some one has the fucking cyclops hammer too
wtf
cyclops hammer is unforgeable
you get it by killing a cyclops on a throne
i know what it is
which i guess someone did
not throne
but yeah that's a lot of artifact stuff kicking around
he's like the sorceress or bolivar or indie pazuzu or solaris
grins cyclopishly
ill pay one more gold for the hammer than anyone else also
i'll trade the hammer for the rinf
u giev
i tested a nazca pretender before leaving for work and my first inca had f3 and my second had a3
then i got laid off
wtf really?
too much luck all at once
luck allocation failure, yeah
yeah for like 3-4 weeks
huh
how much does that suck / how normal is it for your industry?
very both
sorry dude
i was rooting for you getting paid to play mariokart all night
i forgot to bring the danv switch today
anyway ive got 9 more hours to do fuck all for work tonight then i leave at noon tomorrow
the reason im getting laid off is there needs to be 2 people signed off on driving on site on our crew of 3 people
and there's already another guy to fill my role on his way here
so someone who was supposed tp leave tomorrow is stuck here and i leave instead
fucked up
kill him
if i kill him then i would have to do his job and my job because there's not enough people in the company qualified
kill your boss
if i kill my boss theres not enough people to drive on the day shift!
its not really that bad i will just start when i was scheduled to start instead of sitting around doing nothing for 3 weeks first
but thats a few thousand dollars down the drain
all because i dont know how to drive rip
you could... learn to drive?
perhaps even in those three weeks. not that it would solve this problem
also you said you were gonna play mario kart, so clearly you're qualified
even if i learned to drive i would not be able to get signed off yo drive a company vehicle for ay least a year after getting a license
yeah fair

altho i've worked here for five and a half years and it's been keeping me down for that long lol
kill your boss, the coworker, and your dad.
go active shooter wearing a "female body inspector" shirt
i will kill my boss and co worker if you give me the hammer
huh, i don't know anyone off the top of my head who can't drive
but then i'm from the midwest
it has to be a real a+ murder, packed stadium on jumbotron, staff helpless to shut ot off.
and originally from a rural area even
the only people i know who cant drive and are older than ~22 are all new yorkers
actually my best friend's sister put off getting her license until she was like 25
but then got it, turns out being a reporter in outstate mn kinda needs it
i live in alberta lmao
edmonton has halfway decent public transit tho
and i live close to the giant mall so i can shop easily or whatever
we have ok transit
it's not bad if you don't have to transfer
so i can go to work and downtown minneapolis really easy on the bus
but it takes a long time going anywhere else
which is why i have a car
what is weird are people who cannot ride a bike, wtf
i never lived somewhere with decent mass trasportation until i was like 24
if i don't have a working car i assume i will die
and become unhappy
i can walk to a train, but it is both cheaper and faster to drive pretty much anywhere but sporting events
i can walk to get anything basically
but thats because my walking tolerance is very large
i can walk to 7/11 and a bus stop
and i live in a very lucky place
i think it'd be marginally cheaper and definitely a bit faster to drive to work, but i like to ride the bus so i can fuck around on my phone and listen to podcasts
the bus is bad here though
which is shit i do at home anyway so i net save time

okay okay if you do a big dick communion and script it like, master - > earthpower - > firepower - > spheres - > master
master breaks the communion and everyone else can cast as normal but keep the buffs, right?
<@114740794476331015>
you can't force break communion
and even if you could the slaves would be stunned for a long time
hey, he attacked me!
:p
seeking arrow, huh.  gee, i wonder who can cast 3 of those at a time...
wraith lord ignores order to cast plague vs 40 niefel giants
feels bad
it is kind of a bad spell
was he in range
also, plague has an mr negate component

cryle the only way to break a communin is to make all the masters leace

which does like a hundres stun damafe to every slave
does that even work
i think people tried to do it in dom4 and it didnt

theres no cataclysm because this was a day 1 game before naksu made a switch for it

no big action this turn, friends. the defender at the throne of creation attempted a breakout, but were slaughtered by infinite ghosts, leaving therodos to grab the coveted level 3 throne next turn.

finally, a spellchecker for discord
no
top 10 anime betrayals: mammoth nation vs mussushu chariot land
what
discord proudly announced upon opening that i now have a spellchecker inside the programme
for example if you write abyssia it now helpfully underlines it in red
well you've spelt it wrong haven't you
exactly my point!
luckily due to the amount of pre-existing mythological terms, asphodel for example is recognised while aspodel isn't
now all we need is for server-side definitions so for example "samog" and "abysia" are recognised
samog should be in websters tbh

yeah i got the benefit of marverni's "how to break into blood  in 3 easy steps as a completely non-blood nation" starter pack of sites

kelp is a bit browner and darker in my experience
not everywhere on elysium is as miserable as orkney i guess
real kelp forests look pretty ugly from the surface

much like your posting
hello
did you know that getting attacked by the eater of the gods and have a ring of returning
i'm going for "magical fantasy world" and "reads like kelp forest"
apparently the ring of returning doesn't wor
k
does he have that trait
realism rarely lines up 1:1 with videogame symbols
is there a trait for that
yes there is
my main concern is if this reads as kelp or not
the jelly pretender has it
well you know what else i learned too
if you have void sanity it works
limne the elemental queen of water regenning 62 hp a turn can merrily beat the eater of the gods to death with an elemental staff
also you have to take damage but not die for ring of returning to work
yeah that would do it

did you make any vampires in the waste prove near our border
i ask because i mind controlled a pair and it says uzid whatever is their home
and i am wondering if you in fact made them there and you can use this to interrogate captured vampires for origin provs
or if it just counts the prov where they got brainwashed as their new home

you should actually advertise the game, imo
setting it up without the lobby system didn't help tbh
nice he just
refused to cast acid storm
good shit
good shit
is that against the throne
i forgot to make my god cast skeletal body so he died to 50 pd of crossbows foolishly
no thats against the hundreds of birds
in therodos game
but its fine.
luckily he just cast 2 ice lementalns and everything died to his farts
or the replay just bugged idk which
because 237 birds died
goons fear prosecution for their terrible acts
whats a better global, gift of nature's bounty or celestial rainbow
rainbow is godlike
is anyone casting remote spells at youy? if so rainbow

<@148098869782118401>: https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/?page=spell&spellq=rainbow&showmodcmds=1&showmoddinginfo=1&showids=1
gonb will give you much much more gold
i wish the mod inspector cached the game data instead of re loading it every time you open the page
will rainbow make all your provs luck 3 if you are misfortune 3
idk
it will constantly try
depending on dice it will
ah
and then once u have luck >1 it blocks remote attacks
and also just randomly gives you gol
d
how strong is enchanted forests
gonb just gives you infinite gold
very very strong
is it safe to assume enchanted forests +vengeful waters wins a game
no
then whats even the point
enchanted forest+ haunted forests will win you a game probably

.tag ramc sexually aroused by tagging himself
someone better at this me shold attempt to quote add that interaction tbh

i have no idea how to do that one
but im v happy with this
.pretender
ok not that one.
does the thing automatically tag you as self tagger if you try to tag yourself
.request add the comic maker functionality
it does, jsoh
self quoter too
does it also ignore the tag you tried to place
it does
sick
.tags ramc
so if i make everyones name be samog all quotes and tags will stop working
hahahaha
technically correct
!details geneva

is there automatic canceling for attempting to remove your own tag, too
there is no untag functionality
tags are forever
even better
add a untag functionality but only allow samog to use it
the real samog, with the samog role, not any other samogs that may be created
samog bot also has the samog role
no it doesnt
it has *a* samog role
we should probably organize the list of people in this channel
.tag samog samog
based on tag
absolutely not
there can be a group for fuckers
and thats it
.tagged fucker
.tag jonjoe anime
noooo!
bear the mark of the beast
.tag conot anime hitler
wow rude
i never play ermor
.tags conot
hmm
you cant make the role fucker
be lower than the role everyone
so you appear at the top of the list if oyu aer a fucker
oh right i forgot about that
even better
premium fucker status
why am i brown now
good question
you were a fucker
but the fucker role was bad so i deleted it
its true, i was a fucker
i don't even remember if the fucker tag used to mean anything
but i remember that i was one
.tag jonjoe fucker
double fuckers was people who i was not going to allow to join any games i made in the future
or something like that
i do not believe i was a double fucker
there were many double hitlers
and at least one quadruple hitler
theres an amnesty
so jsoh are your condors going to be the usual quickness thunder weapons garbo?
that sounds bad
how is there no automatic much like your posting detection
there's a bot for that in another channel im in
after playing against condors they are crazy
just remove the summon condor spell
nah
there, i fixed nazca
just gotta rush mechanical men
just remove the scaling on it
or that
i remember when supayas were the threat
if you got 10 instead of 20
they nerfed supayas
it would be not that good
supayas literalyl were never the threat
they were fucking ass
when you could make fifty of them a turn they were good
no
they were not
didn't they have a mr weapon
and if you could make 50 of them before you could make 37 now
yeah ok the mr negates weapon instead of mr halfs is a big deal
supaya are so much better in dom5 than dom4
they seem a lot better than condors still
20 per cast
and 2 attacsk with lots of strong and lots of attack
supaya make doesnt scale except on holy . even the spell on it
you just get 2 extra for having the hat on the spell
or 1 extra for having the hat on reanimate
i wonder if any of the astral gath summons are good beyond the big dick merkavah
big blessed on the large awe trampler ones probably
condors have 140 stealth what the fuck
the big difference between nazca and mictlans/xibalbas is
their shitload of sacreds all fly outside of battle
and they dont have to do blood things
and also nazca gets the insanely stupidly strong spell thing
but you can because one condor counts as 20 men when patrolling
thats good
condors are also the best sieger and best patroller inthe game yeah.
ok condors are good
and the best sneaker
but also, they are animals
with 8 mr
but 18 (!) hit points
that is a lot of hps
and shock resist for no reason
8mr doesnt even matter early
which is when condors are the biggest fuckers
!details

same reason ma ulm can get away with a lot of bullshit early and some mid game
it matters when you slam 60 condors into 50 anakites with regen bv bless and they all explode themselves
its fucked up that ulms have low mr instead of high mr
how many people regen bv bless tho
thats hella expensive
if youre playing anakites you may as well go hella bless
may i recommend playing a
better nation
what else are you gonna make
ashdad is pretty good
zimzumzams
https://puu.sh/zpm1l/024a986a47.jpg ofc u could just do this
and then the mr isnt so big a problem
11. still not great but serviceable
12 in dominion
12 in your own dom
does any nation get
taking drain just for the mr seems
questionable
you also take drain for the points
extra nature
bless points?
you can take drain if you strategy is to shit on peple in teh first couple years
ye
ma mictlan
gets 1 n
2a
hmmm
that's 1 nature away from
yeah you can take drain if your nation peaks at conjuration 3
regen and largeness
shame
if you get 2 bonus air points, you best be getting thudner weapons
why not all 4
if you could
regen largeness thunder weapons quickness
why would you want larger
and ultimate hell scales
why frost father
you can get flying units with 6 attacsk a square on thunder weapons
as mictlan
why wold you make them worse
i know, i know
forst father is peak pretender

as many principes as you can and then you fill the remaining resources with gladiators of some kind

luck 3 yomi results: +1000 gold and a gold mine
bad thing abou tthe gold mine is theres some residual yomi lingering there so it has 70 unrest

tired: finding hoburg xbows and using them to to fight
wired: finding hoburg xbows and using them to patrol

<@114740794476331015> pre-emptive stale warning
jb's write-up gives me pause in choosing the demilich
i was wondering how likely self-ownage was and apparently it's super likely
i think it depends a lot on what your faction is
who are you picking it for
pythium
i want arcane finnese and death smite
la or ma pythium
ma
ma i think you're okay
still can't soul drain though. üò¶
because you have arch theurgs who can teleport tons of shit across the map very easy
as well as instant communion slaves
ah yeah. that is true.
and i guess i should have enough slaves to not self-own
but i probably will anyway
is the game running silt
idk ask jsoh
it's probably running silt if it's a jsoh game
yep
well in any case if it is, don't transform them, because it is illegal even if it is possible
if u tranform your god i will rename all of your commanders butts
why is it illegal?
unless your god was alive first
because it is intended to be not castable by undeads
ahhh
but that is not something that a modder can do
what about statueesss
because they cannot be assed to fix their spec values
not them also
fuck
no undeads no lifeless
same
no mindless
mindless would be fine i think
considering the only mindless pretender is one who transformed anyway
or is lifeless i think
collosal fetish
excuse me jsoh you are forgetting the very powerful hamming it up golem for machaka
ah yea
lifeles
yeah he's lifeless
thought it was mindless
maybe they changed that
he's both
in any case
it is not intended for those people to cast it
ty
just took mine
and as a result i would prob not demilich ma pythium
can you make uhh
was dicking around in the mekone game
s banish + smite are pretty good btw
the spell hit yoh with a thousand damage that only hits undeads
and then the transform
or a thousand damage that only hits lifelss
probably can't do both
you can do those, gimme a sec to think if there is a way to self target those
s smite isn't soul slay though
as red rob and i have been discussing, nextspells are kind of fucky atm
the uhj
fire disease removal spell does something like this
yeah but i think it does removal first and then a shit ton of fire damage
<@120391130536738816>
maybe wall-e human is the best pythium pretender after all
give me a minute i'm scriptin here
because i can make him lichman
divine emperor is a really legit pg chassis
i think a sage is probably better
yeah probably
did anyone ever answer what happens if you raid a province someone else is sieging
used to end up fighting the innate province pd but that might be different in dom 5
lol the emperor is considered mounted
good
take the berserk bless and mock your opponents as your pg keeps casting imo atlanton
what is innate province pd
the pd type which the province would have if it wasn't owned by someone
theres 0 pd tho
because its sieged
yeah but that doesn't mean the villagers don't sometimes raise some to fight you off and you end up having to beat up 32 barbarians on la tien chi or what have you (or this is how it was)
hmm
is that worth doing to get some unrest on bogarus cap before i fight him
in the game where you're yomi? why not
or rather befoe i fight jomon to take him capital
you can't pillage it when you're on the province so raiding it first and then if they try to patrol it down killing their entire army at once as well as having a ton more str for sieging the next turn seems legit
how does the income work will i get half only bc siege or?
theres currently a hundred samurai
that seems like a good thing to have +3 strength vs
so it wipl be a ton more strength as well to fight the samurai with
more they have order scales
!details bad

one bad part of this is i will not be able to recruit 1.5 anime generals for a long time due to very high unrest
hmm possibly
depends on how the raid rolls in terms of unrest caused
you can get to super insanely high levels but i've also seen yomi raids that do like 40 and then flame out
i tested pillaging and it seems like it went from medium unrest to insanely high unrest after yoy had like 24 pillagers
it is bizarrely random although if you do it into low pop provs it's basically never even inconvenient for your enemies unrest wise
but i wasn't really counting comparative numbers of pillage bonus
enemy cap might just shoot to like 600 though or just repel the raid entirely
it is a kind of badly implemented mechanic i feel
since bandits are somehow much better than onis
yeah
it's

no they are definitely still kevin lf quotes in messages
they're just. not funny.
i'm mostly being facetious, i know things don't work like that, but it really did happen
if i am regular human, do i get more tired in heat 3 or magic 3?
i did 3 just now and they were very good
you don't get tired at all in magic 3?
waittt
i mean magic 3 heat 3 or nothing
for wizarding?
yes
depends on spells
communioning
you get a flat+ encumbrance
for heat
heat is +2 enc
but 10% fatigue per magic scale
isn't it +4 at super shitty heat?
so if the encumbrance is more/less than 30 of spell cost (its probably not) then flat scales is bettet

is it possible to have my teammate make my turn for me? haven't played a direct connect game before
+ the slave's base fatigue as well
the masters spellcasting fatigue hits the master i think
fuck it. i guess i have to test math
huh i thought drain magic scales were only +/- a small flat amount (1 each?) to spell enc, not 10%
not sure why i though that though

<:weebey:403422121466003456>
wait. does the magic reduction apply to the total fatigue?
so if i cast smite with 8 fatigue it brings it down to 6?
not sure
maybe only spepl fatigue
and not encumbrance
harder to test ij dom5 because everyone has free reinvigorate
yeah there's a turn of my let's play where i try to calculate spell fatigue exactly
and it doesn't go so great

i am a doofus!
ugh that game.
i should be beating arco, but i am bad and this map is bad
you can do it atlanton
much like your posting
make cryle die-le
dyle?
i heard it
though i pronounce cryle "crylie"
i have so much fucking good in that game
<@184675842432040960> ill give u 2k for the hammer
i no longer need gold
i could maybe send troops at the people fighting you
they are trapped on death planet
i could maybe walk to death planet
you should.
do not walk to death planet
i feel like 2000 gold is a lot of gold
what can i even do with 2000 gold
.pretender
send me 2000 resources
pay me 2000 and i will take it from him by force
hire all the mercs
you cant take it by force u nerd
hirings mercs is what got ulm into this situation
lol
which one of you idiots has the ring
ulm does
lol
did
did have the ring
what
what the fuck
i have absolutely no clue
ill pay you two thousand gold to send the ring to cryle so he will sned me a hammer
he was gonna rent it to me, but he lost it
the ring is the most powerful item in the entire game probably until turn 40 but
you lost it
ill make that deal
i think i was walking it back and it got indied
you fucj
lmao
werewolf jones invites u cordially to the fuck zone
extremely dominions 5
another casualty of the throne of bests
the hammer would have saved me like a hundred blooders for makong a robe of sorcery
did somebody
get a wizard ring
so would the ring i guess
for free?
a sorcery ring
this map has stupid indies
for killing indies
it was a ring of sorcery
not quite as good
and then lost it to indies lmao
lmao
like the first indy i run into is a astral 5 mage
against ulms
so he just took my whole army
lmao
hahahahahahaha
owned
gee game thanks
i saw th ebattle report for your second attempt against that guy it was very confusing
cackling uncontrollably irl
why is ulm fighting ulm???
one of the exits to cave planet had a buncj of cirvle masters
and it's good because they walk slow to battle getting enslaved
and then as they run away, they also get enslaved
but i persevered
you should od what i od
and build a lab in literally every province
and hire elephants
please dont
od
drugs are bad
and then my capitals is next one of the craziest thrones i've ever seen
like 700 fuckers
i didnt get any hats from clearing my throne
its not that bad
real sad
it the throne of destiny btw
i scried it
which one is destiny
i don't need destiny. i need points
luck, order, growth?
oh
i got the throne of lots of olms
the stupid fucker idiot throne
seems like a good throne for you
3w a turn hell yeha
jsoh.. it looks like you cant stand up!!!
what
what do you want for the dang hammer
because you're sitting
in the throne
i dont want to trade the hammer ot you i dont even know you
youire never going to get cryle to make an offer
you should offer to not kill him
i have made offers
i want to give my god the hammer since hes a cyclops
all you can do is keep making random offers and maybe he'll accept one eventually
its lore appropriate
i made jerek an offer and he said it wa sa good offer
lol
ok how bout this
i feel that is perhaps a mischaracterization of what i said, but i did say i would think about it
if mictlan is not in control of mictlan. i will give the hammer to the player in control of mictlan.
how many  people have looked at the map and figured out which provinces are many sites
in control of or owner
in control of, but sieging wouldnt count
?????
christ this fuckin' game
because mictlan would still be in control of mictlan
so owniler
i guess
i made it pretty explicit
also cryle please don't help throw the game to dual caps nazca
no, you did not
in fact you immediately contradicted yourself
if x is y,  then z. riidi: uhh ths makes no sense.
is nazca player here
it is bug squash i think
yes
so there is a green light, but that means nothing
i think i can defeat nazca player
you're in the wrong corner
or wait i guess there's purple
my statues have shock resist and 27 prot wheb blessed
im currently a minority share holder in nazca planet
dont the statues have like
map move 4
i dont know
i thought they could walk far because, like undead, they do not have to stop at night
i have dumbass teleport connections so im not really that far away anyway
plus mybe like giants they have long legs
the good statues are jot very tall
the olms what fucked pale ones and had babies together have trash mobility
finally did my turn
so either way my armies gunna be slow
.pretender
!details pankor

im dying
how oculd you do this
take the turn i mean
why
nobody wants that
man
celestial masters
are dicks
getting clowned on by acid rain and sun beams

its for betraying me in the disciple game
pretty clearly false since it happened right after i roasted you.
the epic roast of 'crlye doesnt do trading' despite cryle loves do trading!!!!
cryles loves do trad.e
people should give me things to help fight nazca
he is going to storm one of my forts
i could give you  a shitload of gold for other things
mayyyybe, my other things are also generally in short supply or are earmarked already
.pretender
incredible.
prophet "very carefully"
i could trade you an armor collection, enchanted shield, horned helm
what would i do with that
is nazca snow balling uncontrollably
display them in your grand hall
nuclearmonkee did you see my extremely good acid storm telkhine trip report
no did you post a screenshot
no
or did you fuck it up
he isn't really snowballing, but he has a lot of birds and they're really annoying
he went completely off script and killed 200 things with his farts
lol
and retreated to safety
why would he go off acid storm script
then the pg stormed the fort and died
if you hav e the gems he should have done it
he had 6 water gems
vs 300 mans
<:illwinter:372894192894214176>
with like 15 ghosts and one commander oj his side
i had the same thing happen wheb i tried to get my pg to acid storm in the game i won in dom4
200 guys dying to farts is pretty funny though. did he have no poison resist at all scripted vs late game therodos
ai
oh
<@181529528307417090> let us be friends in the game stupidrobot
and fight the whatever menace, as long as the menace is not me
i am not a menace
my temple in cap burned down in pankor ajd i forgot to rebuild it
powrful
so i have 4 bonus scouts lol
mine did too it didn't matter
yeah i have yo recruit stuff from there
scouts ftw
oh is stupidrobot not running silt
im a fucking idiot. god dammit
oh well i guess
stupidrobot is not a silt game, no
well im helheim and i have no blood research on turn thirty six
!details

well, not none. i have blood one
i've got wrathful skies and stuff online at least i guess
monkey i have blood 3 as lanka, and have not been pressing buttons very well
lanka doesn't need very much though
is that where asrapa is
i think i might need one more
for those
i was doing something silly instead
but
don't you have a good bless for asrapa
yeah pretty good
asrapa are 3
oh cool guess i should press the make those button
yes
and then get to 4 for the +4 str to all demons buff
which is tragically insanely hard to cast at b2 + 1 slave
yeah blood lust
i have barely been doing blood, mostly i have been using raksharaja as dumb thug raiders
extremely badlt
lanka needs like, blood four, alt four and some ench maybe
thats it. you're good for almost the entire game
*badly
oh and const of course
yeah i have those now
gz you've p much got it in the bag if you're not dead
b/c you can make asrapa + strong, and swarm, and skel
i have to actually press
buttons though
i think he's small though idk because i have bad scouting
no i am pretty sizable
and ive been in a hellwar so im not large (sad!)
but im a ponyman so if someone attaks me i will obliterate them probably
lol if you didn't get in a hellwar with the indies and die because a bakemono kunshu is extremely worse at expanding than an oni kunshu
i should have attacked abysia
lol
"i am weak so i'm not a thread unless i'm attacked in which case i will win" - monkee, every game
i am attacking your cap in that game finally this turnjbre
i'm pretty sure i got an event that actually reduced by pd so you will not find it a challenge at all even slightly
https://i.imgur.com/eibstjt.png
pretend that's a ponyman not a abysian
come on illwinter give ma mekone my incredibly good spell i suggested + made as an example
which is going to be a part of my day 0 ma mekone less shit mod if it isn't
whatsit
i love them so. if i had any decent non-capital mages to back them up i'd be owning this nonsense.
i too want to know
it is jsoh a polymorph spell for your gigantic tyrants who are a bit fucked up + hate it. results are:

- not changing at all and cursing a random commander you own (every polymorph curses)
- turning into a super good size 5 polemarch type guy with halt heretic + h3, non berserker and reduces rather than increases unrest
- turning into a fucked up no arms slug body titan type thing w/ more water but less fire magic + being even more angry than before about it
- turning into a gross lame wings titan with more air and less fire + earth (angry)
- turning into a burnt by banefire tyrant with more death + less earth, and being extremely angry but having a banefire hands attack
- turning into a goat
- turning into a mouflon
- turning into a helote warrior
i hate moving scouts every turn
ma mekone's cap only guy is p much a dai oni but without a hat + berserk in terms of paths as an aside
berserk powerful mage v good
i believe they are aware of the problems this causes and it is deliberate
on your 4 comrec 425 gold commander
lmao
who, one day, might turn into a slightly more competently sprited version of this
or this guy, for example
i bet that guy is really mad about not having any hands or feet.
he's!
the faction is such a mess atm but hopefully it will be good
*narrators voice "it wasn't"*
ko apparently has some new ideas for mages for them which is nice
jerek is my
b/c at the moment their out of cap mages are some rando human nerds who show up, and an n1 younger cyclops who is a mouflon summoner
ai dead yet
does he have an idea bout adding #selectevent and making it so you can make a modded spell grant immortal instead of transforming
ha ha ha ha ha, monkee
the event thing is particularly needed
i want to make arenas great again
i think they understand that people want selectevent
how would you make arenas great again?
.pretender
since p much the entire beta testing team has badgered them about it in the dev forums and also in the steam forums post release
good
modding request thread, at least 1ce per page: "add selectevent"
#selectevent "bogus" #clear #end
it's a shame that unlike my fatuous abysian labs not burning down mod, the arena mod would actually be something that everyone in the game could tell was working or not and would definitely come up
arena being interesting and a repeateable once per year thing that was guaranteed to fire and had real rewards
especially since they added the peoples arena
*watches pony nation become even more bullshit*
magic is verboten
you can easily see
as are pgs and the like
what the pony in the arean is
and learn to slay it
sounds like fun

water nations!! (drown vanheim)
.pretender

i attacked vanheim
my master plan is to conquer all non forted provinces with deep armies and make you bankrupt
i would have killed his god but my vastness ignored attack rear and just sat there making 1 skel per turn
after he killed everyone else ofc
skelton
and also burn temples i guess
.pretender

oh yeah i saw that battle i think
make a pretender channel that just spits out a pretender name every 69 seconds, forever, imo.
perfect idea mu
.pretender

why is kevin so obsessed with
quinoa
now solely ewie
<@137038752370524161>
one @ is probably enough
you know the wand/staff style weapons that cast a spell
do they need to be on cast spells or attack to be using it
you script the item spell specifically
right, okay
and item based spell still creates fatigue?
the commanders spellcasting fatigue
spellcasting encumbrancae
so the benefit is solely in auto-cast spells/not needing gems?
yeah probably
a guy who cant cast the spell normally can cas tthe spell
and it costs only their spellcasting encumbrance instead of whatever the spell would normally cost
which is spellcasting encumbrance+fatigue c ost of spell
oh i misunderstood that
right, okay
also you can cast it from the item without having the research to cast it without the item
the terror on a stick one is p. good
or at least it was before the change
its very expnsieve
you mean auto frighten banner?
ye that on
e
the make skeletons amulet is the gold standard i think
ya
banner of the north star is great as an autocast stick
it's okay
the autocast stick of choice is the staff of storms
hey somebody sell me death gems thanks
b/c it is the only way to stop fliers fucking your shit up unless you have innate (3) casters
if someone is in the air when storm takes effect they should be forced to the ground and take size+drn damage
unless they are storm immune
and ping me or dm me so i dont have to look here again
i like making extremely cheap rods of command as ma ulm for indie commanders
b/c combustion is funny
why would you waste your fire gems on that
it costs like 2 gems
when you can hit const 6 and make
1 fire gem lanterns
because lighting people on fire i s f u n n y a s h e l l
just make lanterns like an extreme pro
jonjoe i can do both things
const 6 rush ulm
magic 3 const 6 rush ulm
wow so amazing
why were people consdering non drain ulm earlier
for mr or
i mentioned it off hand
as a joke
oh o
k
but it could work! sure all your mr is shit but you could have
la pyth levels of research
w/ your extremely good 2 gem lanterns
the reason la pythium has la pythium levels of research is 1.5 mages a turn from your capital and 1 command point foreign mage for 40 gold
ma ulm cannot touch that
ma ulm can make 1.5 mages a turn from cap by default, and any fort they feel like, and can have const 6 for 2 gem lanterns by early year 1 if they rush it
of course if they do this they are not rushing a good thing, like their extremely good national spell
on turn 28 or whatever of la nights im going to make 12 mages
at evo 6
uuh
my master plan is to feel smugly superior to everyone that thought you were irrelevant until you win
why do i suddenly have an unsubmitted lanights turn
if i want , i can spend nature gmes to make more mages
with 5 hours left
the game turned?
absum sell me death gems
when did it turn
id guess about 24 hours ago
presumably, 21 hours ago
im the game host so if you need an emergency extension or w/e, w/e
absum i need 10 death
lol soul dog god owned
by pd
he survived but hes diseased with 27 hp or something
lanights has been v. unkind
to pretenders
nice
its been great to my pretender
my pretender died
turn 2
to hyper shitty indies
sounds like good indies innit
like 10 militia and 6 light infi
absum how much gold or whatever do you want
for 10d
he even casted skeletal body!
or a skull staff
dont do it absum
jsoh will use it to have access to real spells
if you dont trade me i will just alchemize it
so you have to beat 20 pearls in price
or , be real, 8 pearls since i took the e god for hammers
18
16? its 16
i'm sending you 13 death gems
unless you only want to pay for 10
whats 13 for
i just need d2 on my pg
literally all i have lol
ctis cap is mine at last fuck you lizard mans
what do you want in exchange
actually i maybe just make a sorcery ring dont i
oh wrong room
well who cares
yeah thats the play
sorry for wasting your time
jsoh on turn 28: maybe i just make a sorcery ring
what if i send them and you make a bvc
thats certainly a possible tihng
i would prefer to wait, so i can make that bvc with a hammer
my godi s making a sorcery ring this turn
and is the only e2 i have
uh
why the fuck is there a cockatrice in my fort
press i
oh
how do i get underwater on pythium
that must be the guy what got turned into a monster by a crone
this lake has 450 gold in it
i guess water rings and swarm
swarm sucks ass uw
oh holy shit
you can i provinces you have a scout in
i never knew that!

also what game turned, something i'm not in?
mekone
we'll see. i've pretty much given up on that throne
fucking monoliths man
i have another spare dorf hammer if anyone wants
oh great anotiher turn
*sees that there is another turn up* kill me!!!!!!
to collect gems you need a path to a lab correct?
you at  you riidi, murdering all those poor swans
wow, that should have said look at you
ok
:kills u:
roleplaying is fun!
ya
hi someone sell me water gems. i will not read this channel so @ me or dm me or talk in chat
[5:13 pm] riidi: sees that there is another turn up kill me!!!!!!
this
are undead priests no longer automatically able to reanimate dead?
no, need the ability
oh wait, undead ones?
bahhh
not sure
i have 1 jsoh
yeah you need the ability
well, he probably won't read that
but that's his problem
unless you are , nazca lemuria ermor and maybe lanka?
that's annoying.  i guess they wanted to prevent people from life-after-deathing into a reanimation nation or something
makes my mound king prophet less cool, though
yeah
you can life after death 20 indie priests on nazca and get 20 reanimators still tho . lol
they wanted to prevent that spell from being good in any way.
or make a bunch of bishop fish and deadify them
its good for making you have a mindless communion
or making you not pay upkeep for a billion mages
its also good for just making ap ile of mages who can fight a blood nation
can you just mod reanimation in for all the nations
without asploding
probably
https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/885384463694067218/b436a57235b1294c0fa4e8e1bdad748085466e70/
i remember when jsoh sent his mage corps into a throne with some neter with the hope of them all dying and life after deathing but his dude did not cast the spell
i killed all of my own mans
extremely fucked up that there aren't more site-specific events
lol i just talked about a turn for 53 minutes
how
the fuck
well i hope everyone enjoys my podcast
you should do your turns like
mu
where he does them first
then he records himself looking at his turn - before submitting it, but after doing it
yeah i have one like that, because i fucked up and lost the recording, and it's probably a better format
but
also
it saves the viewer from going over your every click
and as we all know, the micro is the worst part of dominions
rambling endlessly about the mechanics is the point of this particular playthrough
i usually don't spend a lot of time on micro, i think
i literally watched you, click back and forth between two provinces
hahaha
for 10 solid seconds
i mean i believe that too
but i think that's more me waffling on what to do
than the execution
what im trying to say is
its a waste of the viewer's time to watch you do your turn
as opposed to, you do your turn, and then explain the important parts
probably true
its a waste of the viewers time either way bazinga
if you can't take your turns in 5 minutes then you're doing something wrong imo
.pretender
*looks at turn featuring over 100 mages all which need to be individually managed*
i...don't think so m8
i have to now make decisions about my like 120 mages
and scripting and whos gunna read books and whos gunna fight and where
boing is satan
jsoh your decisions are easy
you set them all to research
if i set them all to research then i wont get to make more
if my research stagnates i wont get to win the game i think
i can take turns faster when i'm not talking about everything i'm trying to do
but i'm still pretty slow
for strategy games i generally think aar are better then livechat
it's kinda moot with tbs but even so
aar miss the total awesomeness of watching the game evolve in real time
but only if you do it right imo
i think jerek's is the wrong way
i think mu's is the right way
when i say aar
i guess i'm misusing that word
what i mean is, i think summarizing your turn and what you decided to do after you've submitted that turn rather then talking through your turn as you do it
ah
yeah i take aar to mean
after the game's over, a big post about it
yeah, it's me misusing the word
blame the time of day
a time before 25:00, on a day ending in y?
every time is before 25:00
grats
you got half the joke
anyway the main appeal of lps of strategy games is the planning and how you execute your plan
and execution in dominions is fairly boring on a small scale
watching you script 120 mages isn't very exciting, seeing your mages form a big fuck off communion who drops a meteor on someone is
dominions usually works best screenshot but that's way more work
ehhh
it's only really work if you make it work
there's plenty of software out there for taking screenshots rapidly and storing them in a semi-sensible setup
writing
plus, hell, you can always just cheat and record then grab frames you like
is work i get paid for, generally
lately anyway.
what do you write jerek
i write esports nonsense for red bull lately
lmao
nice
you should prep a
april fools article
covering an esports game in the most obtuse way possible
throw some complex math equations over dota 2 or something
oh i was thinking about the launch of dominions as an esport
that'd be funny too
pretend it's a huge esports
w/ a major tourney
and cover a game of the tourney in an article
yeah, the best angle is making it seem like a long established thing
bonus points for including non-functional links that make it seem like you've talked about it before.
*nod*
it's great ideas guysing articles for others, its all the fun without actually having to write
ye
instead im writing...xianxia...........
did ramc win yet
work has fucking owned me this week
moved offices, i now have 30-60 minutes more of driving a day with my current schedule, and i've worked like 52 hours üò¶

i'm surprised i'm winning in research
for the moment anyway
yeah, my spies had you as my point of comparison
so i figured i was doing poorly üòõ
i am really impressed you do have that much research
yeah that is
a lot
i assume lanterns but even so
right now nazca and oceania are scrapping over it
in pankor?
nothing but hiring warlocks
im not scrapping wtih anyone i attritioned to death and then had to defend against 6 indie attacks and take a throne
hell, i didn't even get a second fort until a few turns ago

did rockyb cast eyes of god?
oh he did
did they change it so reforming immortals drop their globals or nah
he sure did
dunno
if i give a wizard a sword because it's funny, is he more likely to run into melee in like, bullshit assassin battles
instead of casting spell
immortals don't drop their globals but they do drop their incarnate bless effects
until they reform

overview: the monolith still stands tall but world war ghost now rages on. you may be feeling clever about repelling an attack or two this turn, but the charts show barely a blip in therodoses army numbers. they are pulling more ghosts out of their ass than we can realistically deal with each turn.
good.
i'm thinking of adding a nap tracker to the bot. all commands will be pm only, you can never see anybody else's naps, you can add 1) fixed n-turns, and 2) floating  n-turns notice
you'll get warnings about naps ending soon, can see the status of all yours
i'd appreciate that
any suggestions?
i always forget exactly when my naps end lol
yes technically i could see all of them myself but i promised i won't do that for my advantage in games
bug fixing only
i put them in my discord notes on a person, and it pisses me off
usually i try to write it in a notepad but then i lose the notepad
my life is a shambles
what functionality would people want? adding the two types, list them, warn when they're nearly up, cancel them (either on betrayal or ai or whatever)
should the other person be notified when you register a nap with them
that'd be cool as heck esp because naps oft turn into peace until we both forget/convenient
i mean in theory it means one person just runs the command and both players get the notifications
nap should def be like a binding agreement on both sides, make the onus on the players
but the downside is that it's more open to abuse
be like offer nap y/n?
<@282646158218756116> i will diplomance if you want
any other feature suggestions?
i am not giving the bot the ability to shame nap breakers, and you will never be able to see any naps you're not part of
are all naps just 2 person?
typically yes
nevermore can shame the nap breakers
i think i'll make it so that all naps need to be registered to a game, and get deleted when that game is deleted
just easier for me that way, especially to keep track of turns etc
(a game already added to the bot's db i mean)
don't facilitate the use of nap's imo.
seem pretty prolific to me
my bot won't (can't) do anything about enforcing them or shaming or anything
my main limit is actually commanders
i have many ghosts bur hardly enough commanders
can an empoisoner assassinate an annunaki of the sky
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz7mbbrteb8
nice.
1 goddamn combat round basically
pretty much pushing aside his body guard
im gonna cast swarm
swarm/bottle/skeles
give him imp contract too for fun
or familiar
or give him a cornicopia so he can swarm twice
thats a lot of gems to put on an assassin who might die
all manner of fruits and legumes ftw.
!details

damn human.
ok the empoisoner cast swarm
the annunaki cast living clouds
it was not a fair battle
lmao
do i need to give my empoisoner some sick weapon to rush the annunaki with
like a... dusk dagger
or a... doom glaive?
no bc he has bodyguards
im gonna keep throwing empoisoners at him so i can cast vengeance of the dead and murder him with the ghosts of dead empoisoners
no bc thats mr negates. fuck
bow of botulf
make he brain fall off
i might get two shots against mr 18
before living clouds comes and i need to make a new bow
also the stupid assassin will probably shoot the bodyguards
*pumps fist* totally feebleminded that gryphon. yeah.
i repelled a single theodoros attack on my throne
i'd feel smugger about it but i wasn't even really expecting an attack there so

there's no mr at all my friend

has anyone confirmed/disconfirmed if a unit transforming into a vampire lord using silt gets magic boost to d3b3 if they casted it using boosters (e.g. they're really only d3b2 and were holding a blood booster)
oh <@96715337440952320> thats good
and its like +5 prec too
just need to not hit the gryphon
also what can i do with a shitload of astral income if my only astral mages are the occasional s1 sauromancer
i can empower one and make a hat and then i have an s3 sauromancer, and then...
i can cast acashic knowledge on thrones
ooh, an actual sensible use for acashic knowledge

what does casting it on a throne do? are there more likely to be sites on thrones?
yeah thrones have a high site probability
its still a pretty dumb use for 25 pearls
but i have nothing else to do with them i guess
if i keep empowering i can maybe cast teleport
and gateway
just alchemize them imo.
also good
my 10 pearls per turn could be 5 death per turn which is nice.

hmm, which is cooler - vanarus or jotun
they're both cool
why do the vanarus forest mages not get snow move
every unit except for the pony and the forest mages gets snow move
they're barefoot, absum
correct boing wrt immortal home
ramc i have kein idee mate
they even get the 3 ice resist
they're used to a slight chill but they don't own snow shoes
ez
i bet penguins have ice resist but not snow move
johnjoe the answer to that question is bogarus if they are left to their own devices i think
what advantage does bogarus have for blood hunting
except hte vampire paths
its less about blood hunting and more about research
other than really incredibly good research and recruit anywhere blood mages i agree they have no advantages
since your vampires can then be incredible hunters once you start making them
what about larignon
or any xibalba
larignon is slower
xibalba is also very good at vamp but tends to use the slaves for ozelotlz
does xibalba still have the bats that have in built sdrs
yes their entire faction has sdrs
sdrs for days
swiggity swooty
hmmm whats even the best thing for blood nations to do if infinite vampires are off the table
and dont say send horror since v. few blood nations can afford that
sure <@275205678010859520> i'll join as vanarus
1 sec
how's about "use the extremely good demons with the very cheap 1 slave +4 str buff"
which demons tho
demons are v. expensive
uh whichever ones you have national paths for
cool
ah the overpriced 8 slave demon knight meme
.remember xibalba https://i.imgur.com/mm23dqc.mp4
xibalba
.xibalba
cool
oh let's take a hypothetical blood nation
nazca really does need to be dealt with, even if it's by someone big
that can both make a type of demon (one of any), but also boner fiends
i think boner fiends would be right 90% of the time
in fact it probably works out, we'd have steamrolled anyone else, but only someone my size can deal with nazca
i disagree
bone fiends are chaff
they are good if you need chaff
bone fiends get extremely owned by things like wither bones whereas storm demons are very good even underwater
bone fiends are good chaff early tho ya
and very reasonably priced
its very lol to me that storm demons are the uw demon
poor frost demons
so what do i take for vanarus? they have astral summons but no astral mages right
lol
in siltymod game i learned that storm demons are v v bad vs fire drakes
rip my storm demons
you can take an astral/fire god and make firebirds
that sucks, sorry about that
in dom4 the thing was to make vyeduni everywhere but i guess the com point thing makes that not as good
sages are still v good

s4 wtf
he wants to forge
is transforming a good use of nature gems on monkeyman nation
not usually
do you have luck
probably not, then
misfortune 3 for life
even if i had luck 3 though, would it be worth it
does it even break you into paths w/ the chassis that have stuff like "30% fire boost", or does it literally boost existing fire?
it does break you into those paths yeah
extremely good pan strategy
hmmm so a transformation access nation has access to hypothetically all paths, with enough time and luck
and nature gems
correct
though questionable if its worth it
probably not
probably more worth it if you want thug chassis than path access, actually
uh
wrong imo
?
almost entirely a path thing
oh ok
i can't think of many transforms with more viable slot layouts for thugging
than human idiot
human idiots have 10 hp tho
what you really want is bane lord idiot
and usually come in some variety of old
true
what about a twist fate/quickness bless for vanarus
bane lords are always good
that sounds bad
twist fate works real well with glamor in battle
you know what else works well with glamor
im not convinced by vanarus sacreds
literally anything
just make chodes
including 0 bless
vanarus is not a troop sacred nation
imo
your sacred units are there for when you need to commit a violence to an enemy province on the cheap
since they glamour stealth
chud berserkers are fine
line up a few of them + stealthy commander, very ez
what oathbound really need is a movement bless or something
they are v fat
```
when going up against real enemy armies, two spells that really seem to stand out are wind guide and flaming arrows. not only do you have a highly massable archer to use them on, but your national magic paths are uniquely suited to laying down both of them at once without assistance from boosters or communions.
```
*looks at inspector* - highest mage is 1f with 1/4 f pick
wtf
2f is access to flaming arrows
vyeduns are extremely easy access to fa
correct
you cast phoenix power and use an extra gem
although with conservative magic use my mages always use 3 gems instead of 2 to cast flaming arrows for some reason
do they get great bears nowadays from ea rus
they want to not fatigue out boing
ma van's greatest sadness
is no natural firebird caster
hence linormr masterchef
you gotta either gind alchs or make your god 4f 4s
w/ fs paths
don't necessarily need f4
for the "a mage showed up to pay homage" events!!!
*galactic brain* thunder weapons bless so a vyedma can make your sirins killing machines
if you take fire 1 earth 1 astral 4, magic 3
theres an event to gain a natural firebird caster
in fact, people should be delighted you are ending up with an extra two capitals
ya but you need an at least half retarded expander and those are not convenient scales + paths to take with that
i mean i need some kind of s bless since i'm taking s6 on my pretender
or is that s7 to not get dualed
just 1, oceania can have pythium
he's cool
w t f
good fucking luck, oceania
why not just take 4 and respect that you might lose them to a mind duel if you get unlucky + also don't find any other s indies of which there are several
he's borne the brunt of the losses so far anyway
is tcid still around
if you're looking for sympathy you should play a nation that doesn't routinely get banned
good lord, no. we should both die
but you should die more
ok, that's cool, i'll work to kill you then inevitably do something incompetent
that something was attacking glorious and peaceful nazca

ill make a map
is heat3 or cold3 preferable as a temp dump scale
i dont have fire and the game is filled with coldbloods so maybe cold is better.
depends how annoying you find being slightly slowed down by snow
oh also cold can provoke a shitload of people die of the cold events
does heat still provoke your lab burns down events
yes
cold lets you cross rivers but also amkesyou walk less gooder
boing ill have back 87 97 and 98 and a 12 turn nap and give you a thousand gold?

end of culture!!!!
so the province next to your candles get turmoil
he wrote an entire

holy shit and another guy is calling it a money grab w/ barely any changes

how do i kill uhh
one hundred eighty mystes
why *wouldn't* jojo count?
thanks bot.
the mystes is not so much the issue
geneva has started
well, the mystes are a huge issue
but theres other stuff too
!details geneva

nice.
treat them like you would treat a hundred and eighty crossbows , with no reload time, who have 14 precision
why are they spamming vine dart
b/c they are n1 mages the fuck else do they do

someone cast eyes bc i really want to see the graphs for this game
180 vine dart spammers was really annoying in dom4 but i bet it looks cool as fuck in dom5
i'll be the roundabout
the words will make you out 'n' out
i spend the day your way
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley
the issue is , the foul vapours, astral tempest, grip of winter, relief, solar brilliance, creeping doom, storm of thorns, charm, will o wisp, pillar of fire, falling frost water elementals, nether darts etc
that the guys who are not mystes do
also someone mind pasting a picture of the cast text
you havent lived until you've watched tens   sufficiently precisioned ma ulm mage-priests spam out a laser like stream of 15 darts a piece
i've never seen it cast before and i just get "eh you did it right""
.pretender
boing the way is 999 will o wisps from off the side of the map
its fine i have uhh, bane fire
bane fire the premier way to kill 6 bugs at a time
ill have you know it decays 60 bugs at a time
will o' the wisp casts at exactly the same time as swarm so that'll be a lark
whose random order comes first: the battle
when ive had moak up for a year and ahalf fire gems do not have the same value as nature gems
if you kill a lot of mages it doesn't really matter what the stockpile looks like
like foul vapours is not something ctis is exactly scared of here
that's what we get too, just a standard has cast a global text
everyone is scared of it
because it rolls one million times
freespawn chariots should be enough to deal with moak gem income bug swarm

<@96715337440952320> does a sauromancer turn into a saurolich with silt lichcraft
nope
fucked up
if you would like to collaborate for an alternative lich / vamp transforms for silt mod in the modding channel i would be up for it
but i do not really want to do 300 sprites myself for something maybe 10 people will ever use
i can do that
the sprite is already there!!!

an okay sprite is already there boing
but it is as good as you'd like?

perfect.
that'd be pythium
im not gonna cast it cause muh pearls
nice.
what if... i send you 50 pearls
!details

then i will cast it, and edit the graphs to make everyone attack you
lol its literally just the sauromancer sprite but with grey skin
nazca has only been banned once that i have seen
and they haven't actually won a game yet, just a blitz, for the record
that's called aesthetic management and i like it a lot

but now we get to the tricky part: does it just have the same stats as a normal lich
i put more effort into the fuckin ghul lich sprite
utgard first
listen m8 as the author of la de dana, a mod that adds fomorians with decay face, i appreciate what they did
saurolich has 3 more hit points than master lich, and 2 more prot, and double the leadership, and swamp survival
they spent more time on that than on making the sprite
tfw when you dont edit the graphs because im actually ahead of everyone, but you said you would edit them so nobody believes you
ya i can see it has slightly different base abilities (it is a god), what i mean is should it be harmonised with normal lich
i think it should have 3 more hit points and 2 more prot and swamp survival
hmm
none of those matter really
its still d4 immortal
why can't my demilich cast cloud trapese despite having the gems and the paths and the research
immobile
they can only teleport
he's a pile of bones
he has no hands to swing from the clouds with
he cant stygian either
a saurolich has like 18hp more than a normal lich you turn into with silt
fling him with cloud trapeze it's gonna go everywhere
or faerie trod
or gateway
he has no feet to walk through the underworld with
little lich bones raining down on the population
absolute mess
can he teleport though
yes
oh. probably lower that to the three hp and two prot and swamp survival
fuck
agree
are the teleport only guys allowed to gateway or astral travel
or is it legit teleport only
no
at least not in terms of gateway
definitely not gateway

illwinter level graphics quality
"a saurolich is a sauromancer who has turned themselves into a lich. by means of a dark ritual they have preserved their ability to walk around in a swamp quite easily."
crime
crime alert
why isnt that a perfectly legitimate use of lichcraft
because it is 100% intended to not be castable by undeads
as well as lifeless / mindless in general
but shillwinter's spec system doesn't work for polymorphs in terms of unit targetting
i think if a demilich wants to undergo a dark ritual to gain legs he should be able to
he doesn't even gain immortality from it
i think part of taking a cheap as chips demilich is not really being able to use it for cool things
its enchantment 8
ok but also your pg was p much free
.tag jbrereton lich police
if you are going to go full cad you should turn them into a mound fiend anyway
lol
is that a crime
mound fiend / mound king as transforms would b very funny
since that has 1 turn immortality + is a better chassis for something that has better magic anyway
and also extremely bad
it's a crime boing
whats 1 turn immortality
coming back instantly from anywhere
unlike a lich where there is a 3 month wait
wow seriously
or a vampire who is at least intended to have the time extended depending on distance from where they died but i'm not sure if it actually works
yes seriously
the mod inspector doesnt distinguish between immortality types
it is not so much a different type as a different length
but ya
i made a saurowraith sprite
i was hopin to make some words with people
hire me illwinter
nice
please zip these up as targas or bmps
you made the black spy from spy vs spy bitch.
lol



nice.
nice, nice
for wraith lord since it's a ghost you can probably just have big wraith lord and normal wraith lord
maybe super big wraith lord for pg chassis that's actual size6
boing are you doing a sauromancer count drac cosplay sprite also
is that intended?
should in theory mainly just be a matter of dragging the lich head onto count drac body
probably, they had to've coded it on purpose
also can we have some vague guidelines for what we're going to do in terms of mages
is it going to be like every d2 and above mage that isn't a person or what
im thinking it should be "any that someone is willing to sprite"
which should cover the needfuls

<@!169456837236621312> how do i assassinate an annunaki of the sky
very carefully
mod idea: instead of extremely cold killing lots of people events, rus nations get an increase in ushanka sales, providing gold.
we need vampire, lich and uhh what else
except wraith lord
worm mage is fine as is probably right
ah ok its just those
imo a large wraith lord just uses the bane lord sprite


i didn't have any issues
sick
there needs to be bigger worms
for gods
and giants
the size 6 worm mage should just be a mount of insects probably
vine ogre sprite but with bugs pasted around it
perfect
could modify like uhh that swamp thing they added
for size 6
my sprites are much more dumb

dont use that im making something better
those are actually merfect
they dont have tails
perfect
ok fine
worm that walks is fine as a size 2 er
uhh that fucking owns actually?
luckily skrattir already have a lich form, which is a bog mummy
yeah that ones ez
probably wont be liched ever but it's easy enough
vamp is something you would realistically do for them or a gramma
and lich on the d3 gramma maybe
ya it's fine got ur lich sprite for a bog gygja
.pretender


ill zip em all up but they should be okay. did all 3 though the wolf forms are mostly make the wolf pale by desaturating and add blood to werewolf

i think gramma vampire needs a poofy shirt though
stupidrobot is really fitting for this game goddamn
ohh
are you making vamp sprites for everything that can turn into a vamp??
fuuuuck
i wanna make some sprites for this
in that case please do the sprites for the lankan monkees
raksharaja but  vamp/lich (wraith lord is fine, they're the same size)
jbre are you still thinking about what you're gonna do for stats?
!details

as i have just had my tea i'm just making the larger ones larger, the ones which are sauromancers more like a sauromancer, and the monkeys i will see in a bit
and then after that it's like onaqui who are easy enough to stat up
okay
i was gonna make a list off the stat differences between say, a vampire lord and an indie commander

i am not going to artisinally hand craft 1 or 2 additional attack points here or there
if you give me your mod file when it is done
that can get extremely bent, conceptually
i probably will
but
if you do not want it to, it can also not
how would you even stat up the difference between a gygja, who is just an old nerd, and a vampire lord, who is less of a nerd but has preppy dress taste
interesting a vampire lord has 5 extra hitpoints, which is a lot for a human sized dude
so does a lich
so should a vampire giant have 50% more hp than a giant?
(obviously, for balance reasons, probably not)
absolutely not no way
i feel beautiful
gygja queen
lmbo
very good
but yeah i would be willing to go through and fine tune stats a little (obviously i would not give a giant vampire +50% hp) if you're willing to let me
i feel like monkey vampire should have extra stealth maybe
eugh
no no
no
not a lot but a little
no
okay
no additional stealth on top of the worst mechanic in the game, immortality
i will do minor stat alterations
you don't have to, mod is probably already perfect
flying immortal skratti plz. can just keep same hp doesn't need more
just with sprites
the part of me that dm'd 3.5 edition d&d for like ten years just wants to write a monster template
and apply it to all the stats
for sure you could make increasingly_broken_vampire_lords.xls
please don't indulge me
but tbh the whole point of the mod is to not make it into a completely guaranteed wise choice
lol inceasingly_broken_vampire_lords_liches_and_worm_mages.xls
worm mages are always the same size m8
would be cool if you could make it cost more slaves the bigger the vampire
also very funny
the commit suicide and get turned in a human sized mass of bugs, that's fine
monkee are 1_1 2_1 and 3_1 the 1st, 2nd and 3rd forms of the vampire lord as a skrattir
i'm gonna put a worm giant in a tabletop rpg adventure i think
i thought about it for a while and it would be great
all writhing bugs around telephone pole sized bones
do vampires not have popkill?
no
unless you are running the absolutely incredible dom 4 mod which should still work with the non immortal vampires that turn into evil blood clouds that eat 100 people / turn and only recuperate in that form
that's why i thought they did okay
ok perfect had to fix skin complexion

2sick2nasty
i was gonna say multiply popkill by vampire size
scaling popkill and unrest would seem merited
i'm glad to tell you monkee that the name of the jotun werewolf vampire form is the jotun scarewolf
perfect

new turn new turn
ty
<@185694323407454218> fyi 5020 people left nazca, not sureif you can see the event
actually here's a better version. those sprites were messy in game


<@!148098869782118401>  you got those sauro sprites zipped?
pfft, cowards
i'll do what i can to bring in 5000 more
vampire sprites for silt coming along nicely https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/413860486518669320/414873079202709504/unknown.png
gygja gievs u a kiss
‚ù§
did all of my units die jbrereton
https://i.imgur.com/eqc0hec.png test? is this ok?
hurrah!
also question, the only thing that changes in terms of the sprite is he turns into a vampire right? am i missing something with like size differences?
where is his vampiric cape!
tru
the thing that changes is that they turn into a vampire yes
remember to make your sprite images some variation of 32x64 or what have you and do the magenta shadow also
quite a lot of them
https://i.imgur.com/st3okff.png
they cast shadows in dominions land as everyone knows
>8o
gygja is thicc
what color is the magenta it needs to be anyway
oh i took out the shadows too
because vamps don't cast shadows thing
and they aren't 32x64 or w/e the game takes them fine tho
ahh i am so bad at dominions
yeah but it makes the sprite super smudgy
i have a carrion dragon , with a shitload of mannikins
its for the best.
this is the shade of purple
every time the manikins die and the dragon routes before they get to combat
wtf
oh yeah i should prob release that mod maybe
pro tip: do not take the stupid hp rout manikins with you
take a minor priest who can buff the dragon with the regen + move fast bonuses
remove dream sheep fires
the special-cased sticky flame mechanic isn't really justifiable with sheep now being a real enemy that's intended to be threatening instead of mostly just a joke.
sad
another question
is the tga invisible color black
holy shit!!!!
yes
you can be a tiny bit off black and it's p much black
but black = transparent
updated https://i.imgur.com/sdf4the.png
nice now do puffy shirt arms and you're there
hahahaha
well too late now, got to summon him up again for the third time in like 15 turns
.pretender
great eiru pretender name
.pretender
is this recognisably a vampire

do i need to give him little teeth
#2 https://i.imgur.com/sxjfh86.png
fighting machaka should be like being stuck in the first half of act 3, forever.
hmm
you dont know where you are, what you are doing, and theres fucking pygmies everywhere.
it's perfect boing
absolutely perfect
that raksharaja is getting there, def
lmao 5k left what
are you bvcing it
or was it a plague or some shit
everyone decided to up and leave
so just an event
actually they may have shown up somewhere else
they all went to desert planet and work in a newly found gold mine
i really wish the lab had burned down
event edit: province renamed california
raksharaja has powerful thighs
i'm pretty sure everyone knows machaka is the ultimate nation for flaming arrows bs
you have the ideal mages and troops for it
needs critical mass
very
not gunna cover them up
critical mass is like, 80
.rp
.pretender
.pretender
i miss when he just said fuck
.pretender
i dont
he's also not wearing pants, could add a dick hanging down
that's okay
sounds good
.pretender
what the actual fuck
i'm sure people will make a vampiric hinnom guy wearing a cape and a bow tie and nowt else
just the tip
crawl devs hate everything good and fun
peeking out from under his skirt armor
i was about to say that exact thing!
im already working on hinnoms
bow tie is good idea i will modify
really captures vampire sophistication
make a new set of nation-specific vampire names
imo
so for lanka, you could have name them blood ape. blape.
i am so stratospherically far ahead of you m8
consider the sauwraith lord
or jotun scarewolf
nice

honestly all of those would be good pretender names
ty boing
imo vampire lord should reduce in path reqs under silt
since it does less now
are you making undead versions of every commanders in the game
not every commander mu
make it death 3 blood 3 instead of death 4 blood 3
just quite a lot of them, ie the ones we want to and think are plausible
.pretender
.remember fuck fuck
.fuck
are these all kevin quotes
.pretender
they are kevin quotes that fit into the 33 character pretender name allowance
kevin ftw
.pretender
is kevin an actual person
i never understood this
i assume he's some kind of
lf bot
he is the bot ak was modelled on
kevin is real
seriously
so he's nevermore's grandpappy
seriously.
kevin is a real human person
i miss
buttbot
bot that repeats what people say and replace random words w/ butt
request a feature
.request on rare occasionally, repeat what someone says, but replace random words with 'butt'
do not make a butt bot than kyou
.request or replace random words with samog
.pretender
there aren't enough quotes
say something funny then
.q
.q buttebot
i see.
.q buttebot
its so bad
i will destroy the robot to prevent this
.tag jonjoe butt warrior
well
its better than anime, at least
.q woke
oh
.markov woke
[jcd voice] what a shame
nevermore has never heard the word woke in this chat, im very sad
no he would give a snarky error message
is he broken
.markov
.q
hmm
ill fix this

.q walgreets
can a vampire be erect
no.
depends on mythology?
depends which mythology you reference
mythological erections: the vampire
i feel like
a vampire dick would definitely be hella engorged
from all the blood
gotta store it somewhere
.q
.q
.q acoustickitty
.lf acoustickitty
perfect monkee, like it a lot
.request maybe fold in the lf acoustickitty quotes to the .pretender command
.request also rename the pretender command to something shorter that doesnt suck
.request .kev
.request .tender
ow

dominions vampires need not eat so they don't drink blood.
only the ritual that turns them into one.
imo.
he fresh
perfect, kremath
nailed it
lmao you actually did
ty
the dick hang
at the bottom
üëåüèª
targa em up and job's a good'un
cool
boing did you ever do the second sprite for lizard skull wraith lord
that was a joke sprite
do you really want it
oh

that was the first soul slay
rip me


holy shit, round 1 of combat ermor nailed vanheim's pretender with a soul slay. brutal

ya he got me good
i guess its 13 vs 14 anyway
why did he only have fourteen resist
i, too, would like to know this
if its late enough for soul slays its late enough to wear an mr pendant
he's base 18 mr
that means you were in a lot of enemy candles, maybe with magic
must have been candles yeah
it was a forted throne with a temple
nice fucking dice
u died even at 18
lol fuck i talked too long about other game and staled
he had a mr pendant but that was when he died the first time
to, uhh, skeletons i think
!details

you fucked up. you have fucked up now
i threw away a good lead this game
.soup
i had like 30 provinces in year 2 but somehow only one of them contained a single air site
is this nazca game
this is siltymod game
i let you keep the fucked up isolated province by ulm's cap though.
i do boing, 100%
ok im on it
why did the increase the power of fucking lightning
why. why
it did not need a stun effect
it really did not
mu when are you uploading more lp turns
your lp is top tier quality
my dudes went off script
https://i.imgur.com/3cqwtrj.gifv
it was fine

does lightning bolt have an aoe stun now
ofc
christ
see how the archers turn grey
yeah
is it aoe more than 1??
tstrikes is
yeah
and orb lightning is
orb lighting is *brutal*
...
orb lightning is v. brutal
it chains all over the fucking place
everything dies
that's fucked up right there
meanwhile fire
the key is to somehow not kill you are self
is still countered by
an evo 2 spell
which is why i have those zombu lof lightning there
im pretty sure
that the autocast shocking grip shield is the best thug gear in the game rn
any other sprites need doing?
yeah if they don't have lighting resist it acts as an damage and a stun and fires every round
and it's got really high prot+parry
so it's not likely to break
.pretender
.pretender
<@190292302785150976> i uploaded one like an hour ago.
whatever ones you think are worth doing
i think generics is fine for most humans
im testing now
it's mostly the giants and stuff that it felt wrong on
bt i think it fires twice a round
becasue the spell is 50% cast speed
like idk if my witch king turns into a vamp without a shitty lizard to ride on. it's fine
i like that dom5 makes thugs useful again
he gets feets!

he has a tail
haha
need a larger wraith lord
and larger worm
nice mu
i will watch it now
larger wraith lord is just bane lord
maybe two tiers. size 4 and 6
yes a larger wraith lord would be nice
worm i am against being above size 2 for religious reasons
i mean it probably shouldn't make more bugs for balance reasons
but it should have a big sprite!
size 6 could just be a mound of beetles
that wiggles for atk sprite
yeah i was getting 2 shocking grasps per enemy cast of sleep cloud
maybe have a big bone sticking out or something
what about these haha https://i.imgur.com/5nyngxq.png
so its aoe stun, twice a round
dakini could use vq sprite
could anyone make me soup or wine ples
as well as 18 damage on one poor bastard
oh wait does your mod also make it so bane and wraith lords are transform too?
all immortals
all immortals ya
witch king is fine with generic sprite. he's a man on a dumb lizard

my hero
vamp on lizard cmon
use the skeletal lizard from the tomb chariot sprite
probably
i need soup

made a slight edit
cape color was off
my mage who can do it is out site searching rn, and it'll be a couple turns before i have construction 4 to make win
*wine
wtf
i'm capable of forging but don't have the gems at the moment
i only have pearls and f gems üò¶
k
is the urgency extreme
i am attacking into dastardly popkill nation territory
i could make something soonish
if you don't find someone else bring it up with me next turn
you're taking well, i'd be raging.
anyhoo, anyone know why sauro has big packs of wolves all over the place?
hm in the name of human cooperation, i could send the geoms to make it this turn to warbread, and then decrepus could pay both of us
sure, but i should have nature gems next turn
it's 5 per wine and 15 for a soup, but okay
are you casting moak this turn?
yeah, i have good n income
but needed to route all my gems into several other things
oh, they have blood mages.
nice i got a source of water
now i can make coral blade for demilich
demilich does not... hand?!
i guess you made a copper arm?
<@317410996169736204> your square of talking fuckin owns
and nature mages, powerfully
hand of vecna.
square of talking does indeed own
i thought that champagne glass was a pair of shorts
like a robot wearing shorts like the goku pants
??
i improved saurolich while im at it

it takes me like 10 videos to figure out how to rescale images.
late game might be predictable
ok cool
basically ended up being a recoloured tomb king
then you get the gnome.
no issues here.  did you quit too quickly perhaps?
how much supply does wine give

ok i need to buy it asap so let me know thanku
wine is 50 supply, soup is a hundred
ok why is this stupid bot broken
.markov
ok its not broken
wtf.
<@317410996169736204> move patrol is a thing????
.markov
how do you do it
^
make a move order
then press space while selecting the dude making a move order
<@332710960554835988> geneva has started
nice, nice
you have to be moving to a fort.
!details

the bot really needs a !shame command
then i usually just use the mouse to manually change the order from the order list.
!samog
make wine
it's 5 gems for fifty
move patrol does not make you patrol in the traditional sense btw
it is a move and defend the province not hide in the castle order
ye it's just to end up outside the fort.
wish they'd change the name but they are resistant to this
they should call it move and defend fort
people always get fucked by thinking it imparts patrol value
they should make it actually patrol, imo.
monkee make me wine
in theory i have blood hunters.
in practice i have 69 n1w1 pieces of shit.
nice
.markov
hmm.
why the dog cops then, my *eyes suspiciously*
sometimes it successfully loads the corpus and sometimes it does not
do you mean the province by caelum
add the kevin quotes and the acoustickitty quotes to the corpus
it's also full of woodhenge druids bc i'm a weirdo.
i can do that yes
